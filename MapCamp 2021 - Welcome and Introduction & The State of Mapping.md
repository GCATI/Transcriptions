# Welcome and Introduction &amp; The State of Mapping

Awesome. Awesome. Fantastic. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome to the gut as the. Matt camp can't believe this is number five. I mean, it started off with me going, I'm going to the pub. Anybody want to come along and do a little bit of mapping before it got completely out of hand. And we ended up, you know, in town halls and theaters, and here we are now online, and this is our fifth Matt camp.

So before we get started or reverse course, we, we better start with all the thank you's. Um, our first, thank you, obviously. Is to all our sponsors. So AWS agile Alliance, ease synergy, endeavor, stream sets. I mean, huge, huge, thank you to all of these companies for helping to make this happen. Also a big thank you to all of you who are attending because without you, we wouldn't be doing map cap this year, particularly a massive thank you to Jane Kingston and.

That's one who organized all of this. They are the, uh, the organizers behind Matt camp. They created this environment for us. Uh, just amazing. Um, You know, another huge, thank you has to be, uh, to our speakers. We've got 36 speakers organized throughout the day. Uh, some amazing talk and lastly, and certainly not least, uh, because, uh, uh, mostly poor people from my perspective, a huge, huge thank you to our chairs.

Damian and Jen, uh, for helping get all the speakers together, get all the subjects all organized and chairing throughout the whole day. And I've got to say categories, it's almost midnight with you, which is just like, wow. I mean, Gosh, I mean a fan. So thank you so much for doing all of this. So anyway, and that blah, blah, blah from me, uh, what I'm going to do is I'm going to immediately start out.

So you can't deem it a jet. And, um, uh, could you give us a quick introduction at all? So I've got a question. Uh, what are you hoping to get out of mat camp this year?

I guess I'll go. Because I'm first in alphabetical order. Uh, I am Katz Patel. I'm the chair of the society track this year. And I'm pumped about that. And I guess what I'm looking forward to is the same thing I look forward to every year at napkin. It's the weird connections that we made. Basically, uh, it's not a conference where everyone already knows each other.

There's people coming from the academia. There's people coming from industry there's people coming from the government. And so I just look forward to what connections we can make across all the different, uh, places we come from and the different things that we think about and the ideas that we have, and I will pass it off to.

Yep. Absolutely. Same for me. I'm absolutely honored to be here again. Um, and given the year, but we've had, since we all gathered for lab map camp, for me, it's really interesting to be leading the resilience track. Cause I think it has relevance for absolutely everybody. Um, audience speaker, um, like I'm interested in some of the themes that emerge every year, you know?

Where they're going to come from what they'll be. And, uh, yeah, I, I'm actually getting to, to introduce a few new speakers to map counseling, new ideas, new problems, new points of view. You know, I'm just interested to see how the audience, he was such a big part of map camp. Um, sort of respond to this. So really looking forward to the question and answer sessions and some of the thoughts and publications that have come from that.

Thanks Damian. Um, good morning, everyone. Um, so I'm Jen Ashley, and, uh, uh, then actually a part of my cam. Uh, co-chairing it, uh, initially with Simon and, uh, I'm glad to be co-chairing it with dad and Damien. Um, and, uh, yes, I'm really looking forward to all the talks. Uh, we've been, um, Basically meeting up, at least the speakers in my truck have been meeting up for the past few, uh, uh, months, uh, basically.

Uh, and, uh, I, yeah, the thoughts are really going to be in a very, the singing or the mapping exercises that they're going to do as well. Uh, I'm sure people are going to learn a lot from that and yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. And, uh, uh, the ordinance definitely we'll learn a lot from them today.

Awesome. No, no. I mean, it's, um, uh, for me, it also, this year has, uh, been, uh, fairly, fairly, uh, major in terms of math. Uh, cause very much what I. I mean, most things I've done in mapping being accidental. I mean, I created maps by accident when looking for something else. So I ended up creating an entire conference called map camp by pure accident by doing the sort of just a tweet.

I now have a, a spaces thing, uh, which is, uh, a weekly sort of, uh, podcast on Twitter or whatever you call it. And that was. Finding a button on the mobile phone called spaces and going, I wonder what that does. I mean, mostly, completely and nicely. Um, but it's, it's delightful to see how the community itself was great.

And so we've got so many, so, you know, we've got tools out there, like online Wardley maps, we've got certification programs with, uh, things like . We got training programs with, uh, um, uh, pragmatic Wardley mapping and Ben. Books, so many books coming out of Batman. It's just been, just been marvelous and. And it has, the big thing is, is it's not me.

And it's, uh, it's like for example, Matt cat, um, uh, I've got to say, I am so grateful to all three of you for the work that you've put in the, the w wave has been organized for speakers. We found it's been just, just, uh, um, marvelous. Uh, and to some extent I can sort of sit back into the background except for.

Right now for cause Jane is, uh, twisted my arm and, uh, um, and got me to prepare a talk. So, um, I do know that you've got lots of stuff to prepare because the main talks, the interesting talks when I finished my blah, blah, blah, kickoff off at nine o'clock. So what I can do is I, I can start my talk now. Yeah, I finished a little bit early to make sure that everybody's got time to get to, to, uh, the, uh, the various tracks.

And remember, you know, we've got three tracks. Uh, we've got the, uh, the square window, the Archway and the circle, um, purely accidental. Uh, purely accidental. I say it's not my fascination with learning and everything else, and that I'm still a child. Um, but we've got three tracks, uh, kicking off at nine o'clock.

And so, um, I'm just going to say for me to all three of you, a big thank you, but everything you've done, I have a clap clap. Thanks for the invitation. Good. So any final words for attendees?

Yeah, check out a networking areas as well. Uh, aside from good thoughts. Uh, yeah, it must be good to connect with your fellow attendees as well as the other speakers. Yeah. So in the, um, on the VFS site, there is a networking area. You can also find, uh, the calendar, so you can add the talks into your calendar as well.

Um, big rumor, a reminder to everybody code of conduct, please as well. Uh, and, uh, also, uh, just, just that people know we are sponsoring charities this year. So, um, we've got, uh, cancer research UK, uh, Orangutang outreach and Parkinson's, so we're sponsoring, uh, three different charities that people often ask me what to do about money and things like this.

I mean, I don't make money from having a all, I mean, um, it's just something I, I love doing. And I used in my research, I w I worked for a company called Dixie, but, um, uh, Jayden, Steve. Uh, using that campus and the opportunity to raise funds for charities, which is fantastic. Um, KA, Damien, any, any final words you want to add or.

Yeah. So for everybody knew, um, there are some incredibly smart people already involved in map camp and some incredibly smart speakers. Um, there is no such thing as a stupid question if it's asked early enough and today is the best day to ask it. So feel free to get involved, ask questions, especially if the topics getting away from you, because that happens to me.

That is a fantastic point. I mean, one of the things mapping is all about is a common language, uh, and, and, uh, challenging assumptions. Um, and, um, yeah. Being able to ask those questions in a safe environment. That's fantastic. Kat, um, any, any, sorry to put you on the spot. Uh, any, any final, any final, last comments or words of wisdom that you would might might add at this point?

Otherwise let's get straight into it. Well, I'm out of wisdom because it's nine minutes after midnight here in Phoenix. Uh, but what I will say is just don't stress about missing sessions. Every single time slot is fantastic. Every single triad is fantastic. They're all recorded and you can go back and watch them later.

Don't stress. That is such a fantastic one because they are all recorded. They will be on this platform for the next 30 days. And then they're all going onto YouTube and we're going to do a whole bunch of, uh, uh, what are they called? Uh, slow. Slow watch parties. That's right. So we'll go through all the talks all again, slave watch parties, but we're going to get that organized.

You can comment on them and everything else. So, so it's no longer map camp it's map festival. No, I shouldn't say that I will cause even more trouble. So at this point, I'm going to say, um, uh, I will let you go to get prepared and, uh, for your, uh, very long days and, and thank you. So much for doing this and that in the meantime, everybody else who wants to, I've got a little introduction into mapping.

Really? Thanks, Simon pleasure.

Okay. So I've got to be very, very mindful of that time. Uh, seven me get my shifts, screen up, uh, view, uh, full screen mood. Now I just want to, um, Double check. I can see several people talking chat. Fantastic. Hopefully one of you can see it says the state of mapping, uh, October 20, 21. Swartley uh, can just somebody just in the trap say yes, they can see this looks fine.

Fantastic. Isn't that wonderful. Um, oh, fantastic. Good. Right. So I'm just going to be mindful of the time. I know we've got to finish in 15 minutes. So the state of mapping. Okay. Uh, I I'm signed watered by the way. Um, I, uh, w this company DXC technology, uh, I researched for them and to all sorts of different areas.

And what are the tools that I use, uh, in this, in my research is mapping. Now mapping is something that like, Many many years ago, um, uh, long before I ever did anything like research back when I was running companies. Uh, so it was, um, 16 years ago. So what I want to go through is quick introduction into mapping, uh, what is a map?

Um, because I know that some people are fairly new to this. I want to talk quickly about patterns, uh, get into the subject for culture and then talk a little bit about purpose and then link it all back to what we do today. So quick interaction, um, mapping started here. Uh, this is a online photo service company called for tango, a huge number of different lines of business, a very profitable, profitable revenue growing.

It was really, really quite well, uh, except for I had a problem. And that problem was this person, the, the CEO, uh, the CEO was completely clueless, uh, making it up as they went. Um, and I know this because I was the CEO. Uh, I used to come up with these wonderful statements, uh, things like our strategy is customer focus.

We will lead an innovated effort in the market, through our use of agile techniques and open source there. I just pinched them from other companies and just changed a few words. And that was it. I was just making it. And so I was a little bit concerned that people would eventually rumble, but I didn't know what I was doing.

So I used to read every book I could find on strategy and I was getting absolutely nowhere until I ended up in a bookshop. And in this particular bookshop, the booksellers asked me, had I ever read sun? Tzu's the art of war twixt? The answer was no. And so she persuaded me to buy two different versions, translations of the book.

And I'm so grateful. Um, because it was in the reading of the second translation. Um, but I noticed a pattern. So sounds you talked about five factors that matter and competition first have a purpose of our imperative to understand your landscape, uh, the, the environment you're competing in three, understand the climactic patterns, uh, like the weather, how it's changing the landscape, then understand doctrine, uh, so principles of organization, and then you're into the leadership and the game for that.

And this overlap with the math major, John Boyd, uh, called the Udemy. So you had the purpose you will gain. Then you'll observe the environment. That's what landscape and climactic patterns are about. Then you orientate yourself around this with, uh, um, uh, principles, doctrine doctrine is just a collection of principles.

And then you decide where you're going to attack, and then you act on that's where game play comes into it. And the more you do this, the better you get at this game. And at the heart of this are two, why's the why a purpose. Um, you know, I want to win this game or whatever it happens to be and the way of movement, uh, why do I move this piece of that piece?

That was quite excited by that. And it all depends upon you actually understanding the environment and understand. And that is what got me into the idea of maps. So I started looking into military history and one of my favorite matters is this one, the battle of Thermopylae. So for mystically is an ancient politician group general had a problem.

Persians were invading, uh, decides to block off the streets apart to museum force. The Persians are longer coastal road into an hour possible for mobily where a small number troops could defend against the lounge force. Uh, $4,000 Greeks, the Greeks were independent city states and among these 4,004,000 Greeks for about 300 pounds and, you know, Ms.

Against the 140, 170,000 patients. And this, by the way is obviously where we get the story. If that's 300 from, I guess the point about narrow paths, you can use a small number of troops to defend against a larger force ashy, uh, uh, uh, So I was quite fascinated by how we use maps through military history to understand about battles.

Uh, and obviously, you know, once you start to learn these sorts of use maps, you see the impact, the climate weather has, you see the importance of principles and organizing, you know, troops and, uh, um, you know, you learn re different forms of gameplay, you know, flank and opponent, whatever had happened. But I was looking at my company.

And so I thought, well, you know, maybe I'll be the man, what am I using to decide what we're going to do, communicate with others. And I was using some sort of swap diagram. So strengths. So our transplant army, a high level of motivation not to become a Persian slave. And I decided to create the SWAT of this battle, uh, weaknesses.

The egos might stop. These funds turning up a truckload of Persians are turning up, uh, opportunities, uh, get rid of the Persians, get rid of the sponsor Athenian. We, we, we hate the spans, uh, threats. The Persians get rid of us on the Oracle says of really does fill, might be produced in a few thousand. So I simply put these next to each other.

And so what would you use to communicate and determine strategy and battle, uh, position movement described by a map or some sort of framework like a SWAT. And it was obvious to me, um, that you would use a map and position and movement. Um, but what I was doing was I was using for. I was using swaps. I was using, uh, uh, stories.

I was using various forms of business models. Um, and what I wasn't using was that. And so that really struck me. And so I went round to the organization, told everybody, give me whatever maps you had. Uh, we had lots of maps in there. Uh, we had things like mind maps and we have business prejudice maps, uh, and we had systems maps and I tell one of the systems map, and this is one for the online photo service.

And I took one component and I simply moved that and I asked how how's the map change? And the answer is yes. Well, that's a bit unusual because if I take a geographic map and I take something like a map of the world and I shift Australia and put it next to say England, but it definitely has changed. Um, so why hasn't it changed here?

And the answer is it's not a map. It's a graph, uh, to explain the difference. The three images at the top are all Aiden. As graphs. So you've got nothing to London, but nothing burns. And Dave and Dave are connected by two aides, roughly, and what I'm seeing, and they are all identical graphs. Uh, the three images at the bottom are all completely different maps.

rates the difference between a map and a graph is that. Space has meaning. So in a graph, it's all about the nodes and the connections in a map. It's not just the age of connections is where it is on the map. So I thought, well, what does that space has meaning sort of come from and turns out that the map has three basic characteristics one.

Um, well the most simplest premise is you have an anchor like magnetic. You have the position of pieces relative to each other. So this is north, south, east or west of fat, and you have consistency of movement. So if I'm going north on gay north, if I'm going south going south, so then I asked you to be map business, see why not?

Um, I didn't have a map of business. I just had graphs. Um, so I thought, well, how do we map this next. I started with a cup of tea, and I thought I'd met at the tea shop because I drink tea and I sort of understood tea shops. Um, okay. What's my anchor going to be? Well, I decided to pick the business itself and the public, or there could be many different anchors I could choose.

I could choose government regulators. I could break down the public into different consumer groups, but I thought I'd start there. Okay. Now it's a t-shirt so they all have a need. Uh, the business has a need to sell cups of tea. We hope the public has a need to drink cups of tea, but a cup of tea has no.

It needs T and needs to come and he's hot water. It needs hot water needs, castle cold war cat, castle needs power. So what I've actually got is a chain of needs. So I start at the very top. I've got my anchor in this case, public and business. And now what I've got is a partial ordered list of chain of needs.

So I've actually got anchor and position and the further you get down the chain, the less visible something becomes the more distant. So it took a consumer, uh, you know, you're drinking your cup of tea. You don't really care too much about the power to use, to heat the captain. I'm still missing something movement.

And the problem with movement is that in geographical terms, movements is pretty easy, uh, because what happens when we move from point a to point B, it's unlikely at that point B itself will have made, uh, because during our journey time, it's unlikely, the continents will have shifted for us. If our journey took a long time, like 200 million years, uh, then, you know, going from point a to point B would be slightly different because the chances are that point B will admit because the plates are moving, unfortunately, business, uh, our plate.

That's the economic system, if you can quite rapidly. So, you know, you can't simply go from a to B because the challenges are be B and will have moved. So you actually have to measure movement in terms of change itself, took me about six months, 9,223 publications or something along those lines. But I eventually developed a pattern for doing this, and this is called the evolution access.

So what happens is when we look at out a chain of components, they're all different forms of capital and capital turns out of all three, four common stages. You start with Genesis, then you get customer examples and products and then commodity utility services. So now what we've got is a man. If I move any components on this, it changes the meaning of that.

Great. So. Well, one of the beauties about maps is that they're all imperfect representations of space. Perfect map of France would have to be one-to-one scale, which means it would be the size of France. And therefore it would have to be France itself. And as a map, that's pretty useless. So all maps are in perfect representation of office space, but that's good because that allows us, or gives us permission to chat.

So we might look at a map and go, well, you're missing a component. I can see your assumptions, but you're missing stuff. And somebody might say all staff, that's small commodity these days, robots. Okay. If you really feel that way, um, somebody else might challenge what we're doing. Somebody might say, why be custom building?

Catos why aren't we using static capitals? Somebody might say, oh, it's brand exclusive. Uh, that gives us a unique feature. The point about this, it provides a common language. It doesn't matter whether you're from marketing or from finance or engineering or biz dev. We can all talk about the same environment using a map.

So I'll give an example of this very simple one insurance company. This is the process flow for this particular insurance company, how they used to get confused. They were, um, they had a problem, uh, the rapidly growing. Uh, they were getting more, more servers into their data centers, this quite old, this example, uh, it was creating a bottleneck.

And so they'd come up with this plan of buying robotics to get rid of the, the, the bottleneck and automate the whole process. And they'd spent six months working on this. They had vendors in, or they'd done all their selection, um, built their business cases, et cetera, and say, compute order server server goods, then modify Mount Brandt that's where the lipo from there.

And they asked me, what did I think? Um, and the problem is I can't go and ask them, why are you spending, you know, many millions of robots because they've spent six months working on this and they'd already created their own story, their own narrative. And the problem you find in business is that we often run things with stories.

And all stories are political as in, they have a story teller and we tell everybody to be a great DB. You've gotta be a great storyteller. So when you go and challenge somebody's story, you're actually challenged them as a person as being a great leader. So I can't go in and then saying why you were doing robotics because I'm challenging them and they'll just get very defensive.

Um, so I said, well, can we use. And there's a lot of argument about this. Um, more argument actually then there was time taken to map, cause it only took 10 to 15 minutes to map the environment. And so they came up with a map using each compute or the service server goods in Brack, Mount modify. Now I can challenge the map without challenging the.

So, I'm not saying that story is wrong. I'm just now questioning the man. So they went computer as a product I might disagree, or a service server goods. Then they thought were a commodity. They weren't racking custom built. I thought, why did he go racking customer? When they said we had custom built racks.

So, um, what are the modifications you're doing to service? Well, the service we buy out racks, so we have to take cases off drill new holes, happy plates in order to get them to fit our racks. And that's why you need robots. And of course, in that room, somebody just immediately went, why aren't we using standard racks?

Now, this is the, probably one of, if not the most common problem I see in business, um, people optimizing process flow without thinking about evolutionary flat. So they optimize existing processes rather than thinking about how things are evolved. And it's not because people are daft or stupid it's because people can't see me.

Uh, lots of examples of this. Uh, this is a good friend of mine, Glenn Maxwell. Uh, we used to do a lot of stuff with the UK government. I mean, one particular project, um, saved about, you know, just simply mapping it out, say to 425 million. I mean the insurance company itself was a few million. Um, And again, I have to emphasize it's not because people are down.

They treat that track by context, track by stories and they, they just can't see their environment. Uh, one of my, uh, you know, not to date version, um, this is one of my favorite ones recently. Um, there's been, uh, a map of the industry on my whiteboard for about three years. I used to use it to identify obstacles and plan investments create this hundred million dollar project mapping was instrumental in developing the narratives that persuaded all the parties to go come together.

And that is the map or the reason why I like this particular map, this, this project, if you haven't worked half ready. And it's the greenhouse gas monitoring. So up there in space, uh, that was a consortium, different companies coming together, uh, to build this particular, uh, satellite system. So I love the fact the maps we used in doing this.

Uh, one of my other favorite examples of course, is HST. So James Finley, a good friend, um, used to be the CIA for HS to now does awesome. Interesting work with the Royal Navy and the RNs and others back in oh gosh, 2011, 2012. We needed to, uh, or he needed, uh, to build, um, ages too in a virtual world. And the reason for this very simply is it's cheaper to dig up a virtual world and we'd go, whoops, we got that wrong than it is to dig up English countryside.

And so they started off with a systems diagram. So this is a graph of the system. Uh, this is what they need to build. And the question then came in, how do we build it? Uh, w where do we use. And what techniques do we use off the shelf? Agile six Sigma. There's about 387 million possible permutations of that question, uh, with that particular graph.

And so normally in government, what we tended to do was just outsource the whole lot. And Blake it break it into sort of, you know, sensible sounding structures, things like. Yeah, that's engineering. So we'll put that in an engineering. That sounds a bit like user experience. We'll put that in user experience, et cetera.

Um, and these projects tend, tend to fail cost over, runs, all that sort of stuff. So what James did was he put the maps there, sent me the map. This is the map 2002. And asked me, how do you organize this? Now I'd been mapping by that point for a good six, seven years. And so I'd come across this problem several times and relatively easy, um, because as things evolve, their characteristics change.

So then the Genesis, it's all about, you know, a change. And so what you want to use is methods which reduce the cost of change. So extreme programming. Very, very good there. And when it becomes more commodities. So industrialize you're about reducing deviation. So six Sigma or outsourcing to a utility provider is good there, uh, in the middle, we're all about learning.

So using things like scrum, you know, MVP, all that stuff, we call lean where we're all about learning and reducing waste that that works well there. So simply apply that. Across your lap, uh, suffered the left buildup. Uh, in-house off the shelf products on the right hand side, um, outsourced utility providers.

And so that's what they did back in 2012, the, the project ended up in front of the public accounts committee, uh, being praised for being massively on a budget. And I had to. Uh, normally again, as we said, we would have just broken it into chunks and outsource them. And embarrassingly hit cost overruns because we've used the wrong method in the wrong place.

So one of the things I also like about maps is, and the way I tend to use them is what we call pre-mortem post-abortion. So pre-mortem challenge. Like the insurance company will sit there, we'll map it out and we say, what we'll be doing this, then we'll create a map and then we'll go and do something.

And then we'll do post-mortem learning, using the same map. And it's through that pattern, uh, that I learned patents. So there are three basic types of patterns with mat. The fastest climactic patterns. These are the, uh, almost the rules of the game that almost like the weather, because if I take any, uh, uh, chain use that location, best skating practice, runtime, all the way down to compute.

The first plan you learn is everything about supply and demand competition. It will evolve, uh, then you learn and the past success builds. So we've become very successful in the past. And so for example, best architectural practice with building compute. We're really good at this as computers, a products that things like NPS one disaster recovery test building data centers.

So we've got a huge resistance to evolve into something like a utility or quiet. Um, Because of the bulbs, you get to change your practice and that's because you get a change of characteristics. So you get what's called co-evolution. So best architectural practice for computers as a product in a bolster to utility began to do a emerging Praxis, which eventually we called them

efficiency, enables innovation. So as things evolve, they enable us to build higher order systems, say, you know, get standard bricks. We can build more complex, complicated buildings. And of course those higher order systems, fake news sources of value. Those are just some very, very basic paths. There's about 30 different, which you can use on a map to anticipate change.

And that sort of stuff is useful for things like M and A's, um, seeing where markets are going, uh, game play, uh, working out where to invest. So in a , um, I used to run strategy for a company called canonical, which provides on the core of Bunty. Uh, we use the map to map out the space, uh, how it was changing the industry.

This was about 2008, 2009. Um, and use this to attack the map and, um, You know, the effect was this. We spent half a million, um, took us 18 months. We were two, 3% of the operating system against red hat, Microsoft. We took 70% of all cloud because simply we can see the map. We can see it was all going to a cloud.

This is 2008. We could see the emerging practice. We could see their new applications being built. We knew where to focus.

Right. The next set of patterns of good don't train. So these are universally useful patterns for organization it's about 40th and things like this. Focus on user needs. Uh, understand the details, understand the supply chain, the components involved, uh, understand what is being considered. It's not good enough to know you've got a cattle.

I mean, you've got to know what type of catalyst or that custom built one, is it, or should kettles be more of a common. Uh, then challenge assumptions. Why me custom building Kasowitz. If it's commodity there's about 40. And then we get into the leadership and there's about a hundred different forms of game play in there.

Um, and there's a wonderful book called reaching cloud velocity. Uh, Jonathan Allen, Thomas blur, um, uh, from AWS. AWS is secondary. The book you'll find about 17 pages of mapping in there. Um, including some game play. There's a particular model called innovative leverage commoditized, which, which is within that book.

And then you can use that to tear up industry after industry. Um, but I'm not going to go through gameplays cause there's like a hundred of those. And so I just want to get just how there are different paths you can, that.

People often say to me, oh, this is just too complicated. Um, we just need the right culture. Okay. So there's a problem here by local map. Uh, this is a map of HS to, uh, in terms of building it in a virtual world. Um, What we've got is a principle use appropriate methods. So saying, you know, there's no such thing as one size fits.

So you can't use agile everywhere. Six Sigma everywhere. You've got to use multiple methods, but there are also two beliefs on the right-hand side. You've got a belief. Process I've have people, uh, on the left-hand side, you've got a belief in, people have a process. Now those are opposite beliefs, but they can happily co-exist in the same system as long as long as we understand content.

Yeah, of course. Once we start talking about batteries, at least then we're into. Now one of my favorite anthropologists, uh, was Kramer. Uh, grobo basically said that despite us, this was 50 years ago, it hasn't changed much. Uh, despite a century of efforts to define culture adequately, there is no agreement among anthropologists regarding its nature.

So anthropology style, the experts on culture, and they can't agree on what culture actually is. And so I love it when. Kind of tell me what it's all about culture, because you can just say, well, what do you mean by culture? And before you know, it, you can get into all sorts of wonderful dates. And I think the problem was highlighted by, uh, another anthropologist, a favorite of mine, Margaret Meade, um, who pointed out, but language is a discipline of cultural behavior.

So language is part of. And because of that, that means you won't be able to describe kosher in language. And that's good. It was incompleteness there. So no model can be complete and true within itself. So this led me to ask the question. Could we map culture? Well, if I look at a map, you've got Genesis custom product commodity at the bottom.

That's really just different stages of evolution. Stage 1, 2, 3, and four. And those are just labels for activities, but we have other labels which we use, which have exactly the same characteristics for different forms of capital. So we have practices, data knowledge, we just have different labels for each of those different stages.

So I can mix and match and get concept emerging, converging, accepted. That's perfectly fine. So I can put those at the bottom concepts, emerging converging excepted, and I could start to map something else. In this case, I started to map out ethical values within a collective. So, you know, universal basic income was an emerging, uh, value paid holiday.

We were converging on an agreement unionization pretty much. But then those ideas and those concepts into pair just on their own, uh, you know, they'll base upon things. And so, uh, in this case, worker's rights and civil rights or what Martin Luther king called the twin pillars of democracy. And of course these things didn't just appear and they were based on something else, uh, uh, workers right.

Came from the Knights of labor movement. And so it's all connected back with, uh, And of course, all of this stuff has the same climate patterns it evolves. So what we can do is we can start mapping out of ethical values within a system, man, if I just take the top of this and compress it down, uh, so this is what we call.

So if I just get back, what I've done is just taken that amaze, visible, uh, values that we often see and just put it into a pipeline format. So we just say there's a thing called values and we sort of got convergence agreement. And what values are all of these components are following. Okay. Um, that's a starting point, but where do I go from?

Well to explore this, I got a bunch of people together who just couldn't agree on anything. I got a group of Brexit. Isn't a group of remainders and these people would just like would argue, you know, it was all story-based, et cetera. Nobody was going to see the other person's opinion. I got them to sit in a room.

Talk about this culture. Is she using a map? And. By using the map, it was the same a bit like I'm not challenging your story, but talking about the assumptions of the map saying this map is wrong. That's, that's how we created this. And this is basically a map, a very imperfect map of cultural. So there's many different concepts in there.

A sense of belonging, safety, behavior, values, doctrine, memory, um, you know, game, play competition with others. Uh, but that's all part of it. And of course, you know, when it comes to culture, so, you know, we're not singing and we don't belong to one collectively not belong to many. And, uh, Family, you know, nation state, uh, maybe a football club or maybe a church or something we owe your company.

You belong to. And you can't just copy that each you can't just say, well, if we copied the values and beliefs of this company to this company will be identically the same and what you might be, because you've got all these other components involved, uh, which are. Uh, you can do things like you can adopt, uh, uh, values you can adopt say, or will you doctrine for example, uh, just be mindful of the landscape.

So you can take principles from one company and apply them to you. So it won't make your culture the same. Cause there's all these other components, but you can adopt. Okay. And there are feedback loops. Uh, so you know, are collected depending on how successful we are spreading values that influence our behavior and our sense of safety and our sense of belonging to the club.

Of course, these can be negative as well. So I've been very successful when we stopped getting back the other way. So on. Well, you can manipulate once you start mapping out spaces, but like gameplay, then you can start something now. These sorts of spaces. And so one of the ones that interest me is, you know, we often talk about power with, and so we often talk about power, social structures, and power with others.

I like power, we as a collective one control over and environment. And then, but there are different forms doing this cooperatives, communism, whatever it happens to be, would it be. Levels of success in terms of spreading their values. Now there's also a power over, and this is all about the individual advocacy.

So not power with others, there's power over others. Um, so it's all about my agency. Of course, that requires a collective power over. And of course there's different ways of doing this, you know, dictators shit or, you know, market system based upon exclusion, whatever it happens to be. And they have different levels of success and spreading them.

And of course, then there's power T, which is why I power over. And I give that power to somebody else too. And, you know, that's the act of sharing. So that depends upon the batteries. Um, again, within the system, I like this stuff because, um, all of this stuff is connected in this case to values. And so if you alter that, uh, you can, you can change, uh, the balance of different types of.

Well, at least that's the idea of what people are experiments with and certainly have been experimenting with for a long time. Cause you change the values through things like that. You know who in the past may be statues and the paintings. And then it eventually became things like Hollywood and things like the Avengers movie.

Um, I mean that's probably the most valuable out there is out there these days though, that art is now in turn. Video games, interactive, immersive experience where again, organizations, uh, groups are, um, trying to subtly alter people's values through the playing a video game. So this is, uh, this is a particular one from Hezbollah.

Um, I like this, what project? Viola SIA, trying to change, uh, behaviors, uh, in a positive. So why does that matter? Well, it sort of matters because, uh, when we think about nation states are all in some sort of competition, I suppose, with each other and in a physical world, we think of it in terms of here we are as a nation, here's our border.

Um, but sensitive subject with Brexit, obviously, but here's our collective, our behaviors, our values within this. And sometimes we have conflict with others. Hopefully we don't. There are many ways of changing the game. One is to change the values of the people within that collecting. We changed them all to be like, you.

How you and we do exactly the same, um, but not on physical spaces in economic and digital spaces. Uh, so, uh, you know, we have, we should have the here's the economic system. This is our border. This is where our collective, our behaviors, our values, uh, except for we died, uh, because of. So we don't have any maps, so we can't see what the borders are.

I mean, we're terrible. I mean, uh, uh, as we're discovering feedback on the status light shades, let alone map it. Um, but if you do that, you start getting into mapping. You, you start to realize that as a collective, and this has been going on, you can embed values through things like simulation models into AI systems.

So this is the whole Beijing versus, uh, China. Um, and by that use, I mean, it's just something as simple as the trolley. So you that you pick any vehicle were to pick a self-driving car. A car comes along, you can kill five or five people at one who did kill what depends very much on the values of your society.

So if you value individualism money and one person extremely wealthy, it's tough luck for the five people. If you value, you know, collectivism or Confucian ideas, then it's tough out for the one. So our values will be embedded in the simulation models, which are embedded in the AI systems. And of course, we've got this, this, this game going on.

I won't bore you with that. It just China one that, so, um, even the Pentagon now pretty much agrees that, uh, and that the UK has just announced this national AI strategy. It says that it's a bit like Oracle turning up to the cloud seven years after the battle's already been fought. So I often get asked these mapping just about conflict, therefore.

Well, no, it's about competition and competition is about seeking something together. So it's about seeking a resource, seeking a knowledge of something, and there are many different ways of doing that. Um, there may be conflicts of fighting. Uh, one may be cooperation working together once collaboration, laboring together, and these are all different plays in that space of competition.

And, and you know which one you use? Well, a lot of the time depend upon what your, your purposes. So to explain it. This is a quite old map. This is my map of mapping itself. So one of the first things I did with mapping, uh, was actually to map it and I use this map of mapping and have used it to sort of manage where I'm taking, um, mapping itself.

Now we start off with a purpose. It's got scape, it's got various components like doctrine, climatic patterns. Um, but there's a company. The conflict is here. My imperative, my imperative is to rebel against consultants that enslave us. I, I've never been very happy with the big consultancy firms. Um, and the same for the last 15, 16 years.

I mean, I keep on reading, you know, the many times McKinsey is we brought in scandals, all these sorts of stores. I'm not a fan. And so. I tried to do was what I was hoping to do with mapping was to give people the tools to actually understand their environment. It's um, what CA called the, uh, epistemic justice league.

It was like it's, um, it's all about giving people really that freedom, freedom to understand the environment, that patterns from each other and not have to rely on sort of some supervisory tower, uh, some sort of magic. Okay words, uh, which is how I see my consultancy industry. So I decided to use collaboration, cooperation without this, to tackle this conflict.

So this is why you think things like learn mapping the doctrine, you know, the climactic pants. Um, it's basically me, you marshaling others who have the same problem, so to fight against, or to, to rebel against the large management consultancies, which tend to enslave corporate. And gosh, I started this journey 15 years ago and it's just been incredible.

I mean, we've got so many good things out there. Um, uh, tools, for example, I absolutely love online Wardley maps. It's not the only tool. There's several others and people are starting to build repositories of maps and everything else. This stuff is fantastic. Um, milk's, uh, I mentioned the AWS, but we've got flow architectures by James Earhart.

You've got to have building software platforms. That's coming at the moment. There are lots, lots of books being produced now or mapping, um, which is great to see. Um, I love the train. Um, Ben does his pragmatic Wardley mapping, if not the other one, not the only person who does mapping courses. Uh, there are several of us.

But one of the things I particularly like about this is, uh, I know you will uncover opportunities worth a hundred times the course of price. In fact, I guarantee it or I'll give you your money back. I love this. Tell me to do the training. If you don't make a hundred times the value. Uh, uh, the cops or the books would just give you your money back.

I mean, I can't imagine a big consultancy firm ever coming to me and saying what build that government project for 2 million. And if you haven't made 200 million in government, we'll just give you 2 million back. It just wouldn't happen. I love this sort of attitude, the focus on body, the focus on user need.

Uh, we're also starting to get, you know, practitioners certification exams with, uh, the entire field is being pressured out, uh, with groups like , uh, which is, uh, education charity. I mean, this is really exciting. Uh, we had a lot of talk about recently back creating a mapping foundation. So, I mean, it spent some time there steep percuss that says Steve's Twitter handle smokers.

Um, we talk about what we needed to, to create a foundation, uh, Again, the values that we need to have, what the purpose would be supporting the community, what it would need to provide, what it actually would cost to do this properly. And so we went through this process and we haven't raised it yet because, uh, there's sort of a realization is, well, does the community really want this?

Okay, well, that's, that's put up the funds. Um, what we're calling. And just ask people to contribute. So we reckon it costs about a hundred thousand to, to get this off the ground. If people there is now a go fund me page, and if ever, we get to the a hundred thousand and Steve Albert, this thing, and if we don't, we won't, but what we'll do is next year, we'll ask the same question.

And so at some point in the future, there'll be enough companies, enough people with enough interest that will actually make.

Oh, and lastly, there's things like map camp, these events, uh, Matt camp, isn't the only event. And I'm a huge, thank you for Steven and Jane for putting this all on, but this is where we all sort of come from. So I'm giving you an introduction to sort of where mapping started. And the idea of Matt talked a bit about patterns.

I've talked a bit about, um, uh, culture, and then I've talked a little bit about my purpose, where I was taking mapping, what I wanted to do, but there's something else. Uh, we've got a climate catastrophe heading towards us. Um, and we're not going to mitigate the effects of this with a, I love grits.

Thornbirds blah, blah, blah, with just stories. Uh, we're not going to mitigate the effects of, we just have. Poor communication and conflict. Now we're not going to mitigate the effects unless we start getting a handle on their supply chains and we're not going to mitigate your effects unless we start really understanding the values we have in society and how we change those values.

Um, so all of these components are hidden away in that camp. There's three windows. The first window is all about resilience. Uh, second window is about that idea of sustainability and understanding components from the supply chain and the third that windows or. Society itself and understanding things like values.

And those for me are three critical components. If we want to help mitigate some of what's heading towards. So I've done that blah, blah, blah, myself. I'm going to say have a wonderful day. There are some truly amazing speakers and really interesting talks. Um, uh, during the. I mean, it's really good stuff.

Are we hanging around chat? So you're welcome to always come and talk to me and, um, of them will say is thank you. Uh, enjoy yourself, have a lot of fun. And, um, hopefully I'll see you at the fireside chat at the very, very end of the day. Thank you.

At this point.

I will close everything down. Oh, do I close everything down? VFS? Are you still with me?
