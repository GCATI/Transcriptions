<h1>MapCamp 2021 - Maps, Ethics and Power</h1>
<p>People a moment to start filing in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right. Folks are starting to file in. So I'll go ahead and start out here. Okay. I'm Katz motel. I am a, the track chair, I guess, for the society track here at napkin and, uh, today. Our posts Q and a post lunch session here is maps, ethics, and power. And I'm so excited to be joined by these amazing panelists and very excited for the session.</p>
<p>Uh, I'll just remind folks that you can use the Q and a, you can put questions in the Q and a at any old time. You'd like you don't have to wait for one of the speakers to be done. You can QA in there at any time and I'll go ahead and curate that for our panelists. The format is going to be 15 minutes, uh, talk from a panelists and then we'll have some discussion and then another talk and then more discussion and on and on like that.</p>
<p>Uh, so I hope that works for everyone. Uh, yes. So I guess we can go ahead and get started and we're going to start off with Caitlin. Uh, or should I say Dr. Caitlin McDonald's were very happy to have you here joining us. She is. A digital anthropologist at DXE, uh, at the leading edge farm in DXE, uh, working with Simon Wardley and a bunch of other amazing folks.</p>
<p>And I am so pumped to hear your talk and get a little peak into your research. So without further ado, go for it. Super. Thanks, Scott. Thank you so much for sharing today. You've been doing such a great job of linking all the sessions together. I've really been enjoying how much linkage there is. So hopefully we can continue some of those themes.</p>
<p>Uh, let me, I literally just shared my screen and now I've lost a button to do that because life is like that sometimes. Uh, please hold everyone. There we go. All right. Sure I'm present. Okay. So we're going to talk a little bit about growing digital ethics and practice, and some of you out there in the audience may have seen me present on this before.</p>
<p>But the thing that I can add today is that both tapa and Ann are going to talk a little bit about how this actually plays out in a real world context. So I will lay out the kind of theoretical foundations. And then from there, we'll have some real world examples to play as well. And I know you've been asked to put some questions in the Q and a, but I first have a question for you.</p>
<p>So please feel free to put this in the chat, uh, share on Twitter, uh, share in the chat room, wherever you like. Um, have a little think about this because I imagine that there might be something that keeps you awake at night. What digital ethics question keeps you awake at night? What keeps you up? Um, what kind of pings you?</p>
<p>Uh, what's what's on your mind in terms of digital ethics today? I really want to know, and please bring that up in the Q and a. Um, so I'll tell you what keeps me awake at night, which is that increasingly, uh, business and policy decisions are very kind of data-driven. And in fact, it's not just about business.</p>
<p>It's about every aspect of our lives. More and more. We live in a very, what I call digitally mediated society. So you almost can't do anything without a computer or a phone or something of that nature, um, helping you with that transaction. And as a result of that, um, you're kind of in these systems where, um, you have to depend on those systems to work, to treat you fairly.</p>
<p>Um, and in particular, you need to be able to have some kind of mechanism for redress when something goes wrong within those automated systems. And often we don't have that. And that keeps me awake at night. Um, but speaking of businesses again, I think there are kind of three huge levers that really drive the way that businesses think about digital ethics.</p>
<p>And I was actually on a different conference today. Sorry, Simon, I've been skipping back and forth, um, a conference called , which is actually one of the largest spanking conferences in the world. And they were actually talking about this as well. And what they were saying is there are increasing pressures, reputationally.</p>
<p>In a revenue way and also in a regulation way to, um, drive forward digital ethics agendas. And in fact, this is really kind of the three strategic drivers for any kind of business thing that you choose or do any kind of choice that you make in business. You're going to be looking at it from one of these angles and want to talk about reputation in particular.</p>
<p>You know, this isn't just about PR it's also about how do you attract the right talent that actually wants to work with you and shares your company values and aligns with that. And also, how do you make sure consumers perceive you as a valuable choice? And in fact, you can kind of look at this, um, you know, not just as a kind of hygiene factor as an, I don't want to buy from that group, but also as if you think about something like, um, the ethical consumer mark, or, um, fair trademark, um, those are things that consumers seek out and actually wants to have.</p>
<p>So reputation in this, in this instance can be something that really serves you as well. Um, and for those of you who are joining and going, where's the map, I promise you something is coming. So stay with me. Okay. These are just examples of the kinds of things that can go wrong with digital ethics. I feel like I don't need to familiarize you with them.</p>
<p>I think we've all seen them coming up over and over and over again in the headlines. And you know, you certainly don't want your business having a challenge like this coming up for you in the headlines, but there are some good things I can do as well. So, um, just one example might be, um, that, uh, one school district during the pandemic was really struggling to get students online.</p>
<p>Um, this, this example is from the U S but I happen to know from data from Nesta here in the UK, that I believe it's 19% of, um, Scottish people do not have sufficient data to access their day-to-day everyday needs, um, to get their needs met, to, to use services and to do the things that they need to do, including essential government services that they need.</p>
<p>So that's a huge challenge. And, uh, one way that a school district, uh, dealt with that was to put, take all the school buses that weren't being used, put them in neighborhoods and use them to give students wifi so that they could actually access the school they needed to have. Um, I also want to reassure you that if you are concerned about digital ethics, first of all, you're not alone.</p>
<p>This is a thing that's coming up over and over. And in fact, the banking conferences that I was at, um, really kind of high level, you know, people who you think of as being extremely focused on just the money. They actually really think about this stuff a lot, mostly because it does impact the money. So there are a lot of tools available for you.</p>
<p>Um, you don't have to feel like you're starting from scratch. If you are trying to do something with digital ethics, there are plenty of kind of standards. Uh, rules-based things that you can see that the puts out. There are more speculative things that you can use, like the data ethics canvas to help you think through some of the challenges you might be facing with your organization.</p>
<p>And finally we come to what is not exactly your map, but it's definitely map inspired. So you, of course, I think on this call are all familiar by this point in the day with the concept of pioneer settlers and town planners. And I know that there are some questions about whether those are the right names for things.</p>
<p>Um, but stick with me, really what I'm getting at here is, um, you have a situation where often you have an ethical choice. If you're a small business where, um, you don't necessarily know what the impact of the choice that you're making is, or if you're making a new service within a business, that's kind of very smaller experimental.</p>
<p>You may have no idea what the ethical impact of that is. Scale way up on the other end. You're a huge diet mega Corp, and you do things all over the world and you serve as products that people rely on every day. In that instance, um, those are usually quite heavily regulated industries because actually, um, the harm is usually pretty well known by the time something becomes that industrialized.</p>
<p>So as a result, you can depend on quite rule-based regulatory frameworks to assist you in those choices. Um, and often there's a kind of conflict in the digital ethics world that says you have to choose. What's called the teleological approach, which means I'm just looking at the possible consequences of something.</p>
<p>No, no, no. That never works. Teleology is always wrong. Those people are terrible. Their morals are bad. You have to choose a rules-based approach. That's the only way that you can be assured that you're doing the right thing. Um, and in my view, it's actually, you can appropriately size these depending on how mature something is, because if you really don't know what the consequences are, um, you, you ha the, the choices that you have are very kind of what if faced.</p>
<p>And that doesn't mean that you don't have any ethical choices to make. And often, um, Chris Daniel and I have had conversations about this in the past where he's like, well, you know, pioneers don't really care about this. And I'm like, they do care about interests. They do. And they also have options for how they can address those issues.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that you have no tools available to you. There are plenty of tools there, uh, but also if you are in a much more kind of industrialized state, you might find you have a much more procedural approach to how you deal with digital ethics. And I can take you through some examples that are, but I'm also aware that we're only supposed to be doing 15 minutes.</p>
<p>So. Behold here is a map. Um, you will get the slides afterwards. So if you want to take this away and use it, um, please feel free to do so. I think this is just a starting point as all maps are. Um, but in essence it says exactly what I've just said, which is if you're in a situation where the S the scenario is rare, it's poorly understood.</p>
<p>You don't really know what the consequences are then. Um, you know, you have some choices around how you decide to consider your ethical approaches on the other end of the scale. Um, you have some choices around how you consider an ethical approach in a very industrialized way. Often the challenge, I think, is the sticky middle, where you're passing between a situation where you could get away with not having a lot of, um, regulatory or, um, procedural based things going on for you.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you find that you do need those things. And if you're kind of in that threshold area, you know, the settler place is a little bit challenging to deal with. Um, so you can ask yourself questions, like, what are the, what are the ethical challenges that we face in a kind of pure conjectural space?</p>
<p>Um, and you might come up with some novel approaches to that and depend a lot on future thinking. There are some techniques of futurism that you might use around, um, like using a futures wheel or running some design thinking programs that might really help you. Um, if you're in the middle, then you might formalize those a little bit into kind of slightly more.</p>
<p>Um, uh, procedural checklists around, we always make sure that we check with these people within the business and the stakeholders outside of it. Um, if you are a giant mega Corp, then probably what you have is external regulators who are telling you what you should be doing. And, uh, one interview that I worked with previously was saying that what you need is a relationship, a very cordial, um, standoffishness between the regulator and the industry that is being regulated.</p>
<p>And if there is one, some kind of external assessor or auditor, because if they're all cozy together, then you can't rely on them to be very good at checking each other's work. So you really need those relationships to be respectful, but almost adversarial. You need them to be very, very carefully checking one another's work.</p>
<p>So you got to assume that when you are a very large business, you are going to have some external oversight that probably wasn't there. When you start. I mean, of course, to the extent that when you start out, presumably you have to operate within the legal frameworks that, you know, but if there are things that you don't know, because it's so novel and so rare and so new, then you can only depend on what you, what you do know.</p>
<p>Right? So here are some further resources, which you are welcome to go and check out and I will leave it there and open up to questions. I know we've gone through that very quickly, so I'm very happy to go back if anyone's concerned or has questions, but just please be, please be reassured. If there's one thing you take away from my talk, it is that you are not alone.</p>
<p>And there are many, many resources that you can use. If you are concerned about digital ethics within the organization that you're working in, there are lots of places you can look for help, and I'll go back to the resources slide, because I think that's probably the most useful one to do.</p>
<p>Okay. Wonderful. All right. That was a lot of ground to cover in a very short amount of time. And I'll just say that everyone knows, uh, and, and toppy, if you want to direct any questions to Caitlin, that's totally fine. You'll just have to unmute yourself and you can certainly direct some questions. Uh, but I'll go ahead and, and do you have a question?</p>
<p>Oh, I do have a question. Yes. So, uh, so, um, can you think of a good example of, uh, technological and the day launch a logical factor? Um, go on in the moment in ethics. Um, I feel like you might have some in mind, so I might kick that one back to you, but I will, um, let me take us back to that slide. So people kind of, um, know what those things are.</p>
<p>So I would say, uh, an example of a really clear example of something that's happening, which is on the cusp of being data to logical is, um, the increasing regulatory attention that's being paid to Facebook and to other large tech bodies, but in particular, Facebook has been, you know, um, really, really cutting it a lot from various regulatory agencies in the U S not only the, the, uh, the FTC, um, but, uh, so as an antitrust, um, but also from other kinds of regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>So I would say that, uh, the deontological perspective is finally coming to pass on Facebook and how that is set to work at. We have yet to see, but, you know, the second they are up in front of congressional hearings, I would say that's a deontological perspective that you're approaching a teleological perspective.</p>
<p>Um, perhaps something like. Um, interestingly, I feel like this one is actually a little bit more industrialized. Some people give it credit for, but something like, um, the space industry, because there's a lot around. And actually having said that, I would like to retract my answer, because if you think about it, like there's a whole bunch of stuff around people going up in space, but a lot of the issues around, um, how do you manage spacecraft, um, potentially banging into each other and, you know, um, who owns particular bits of space?</p>
<p>A lot of that's already been worked out because of prior non-human, um, examples of, of space being used. Um, although I think there probably still is plenty that is theological in that way. Um, but perhaps something like maybe quantum computing, something that's like really on the cusp of, we're only just starting to hear about this now or the metaverse would be a good example.</p>
<p>I saw an article the other day about, um, somebody saying, Hey, you know, um, when an immersive experience has really emerged. Then bullying is way worse than if it's just in text, on somebody's screen. So that is a whole other animal, you know, and that's not to say that you don't have some resources to think about how do we consider, what do we do about the problem of bullying online?</p>
<p>We do have resources around that, but there is a unique concern, which is when it's a lot more visceral than it was before. How do we address that issue? So I would say that's probably an example, that's in the teleological camp</p>
<p>and I also will also say that that's slightly covered in book two if Mike an optical series. Excellent. Thank you. Good to chat out there. All right. Uh, we do have a question about Facebook as you're talking about Facebook. Uh, basically the question is calling out. Facebook. Yes. They're having these congressional hearings and kind of being called to the world stage in terms of like, how do we regulate this, but still very much also in the break things space.</p>
<p>Uh, so how does that work with this? Yeah, that's a great point. You know, I'm not saying that they have yet been fully absorbed into the deontological side. I'm saying that there are some players now who are starting, you know, that you would traditionally think of as being on that side, who are the regulators and, um, you know, the kind of various external bodies that put regulation on you, they're starting to pay attention.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that that is that transformation is fully happened. You know, they're not like a public utility, for example, like electricity, where, um, the regulation is quite, you know, or something like, um, public safety laws or, um, you know, uh, in the U S OSHA concerns, like things that are very kind of heavily, you know, you have to go through your online safety training and you're like, I'm never going to lift a box like that.</p>
<p>It's fine. But the reality is, as people aren't wants to say trade unions in particular, um, all of those safety regulations are written in blood. And there's a reason that we have them, you know, because someone did something that really was really painful for them. So I think that Facebook is in that kind of early stage where like the eye of sour on is turning their way and it hasn't yet.</p>
<p>I managed to achieve its goal in terms of actually putting some codes down. All right. Very interesting. Uh, yes. And folks can continue to put things in the Q and a if you'd like, um, I am very interested in this. So I'm in a master's program. That's about science and technology policy. And as part of that, I've read, I don't even know how many congressional hearings at this point, like read the actual transcripts of them.</p>
<p>And it is extremely painful, just as painful as you. Imagine, I'm sure if not more painful. Um, but I guess what is really interesting to me is that when you get to the point of the regulators being interested, the first thing that they want to try and I understand the reason is to, uh, look at the existing regulations and say, how could they be applied to this thing, even when this thing is fundamentally changing the rules of the game entirely.</p>
<p>Right. Uh, so I guess as we go into this era where it does seem like things are shifting pretty rapidly, uh, is there anything that all of us can do. To, uh, like maintain that actually productive adversarial relationship with regulators, but also let them know like the rules of the game have changed and you can't use the existing regulation to try to like, make this safe for consumer.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that's such a great point, Kat, and I think it's worth saying that like all maps, you can view this in a kind of fractal way where, you know, you don't just have to view this as saying, oh, a regulation will happen eventually, because actually what you're really describing on the industrial side here is any kind of systematic approach.</p>
<p>So if you're a small, you know, imagine I start, I started startup and it's just me and you cat and that's it. Right? So like, we start out with. We have some concerns, you know, maybe 50 people are buying our products that doesn't have a huge amount of infrastructure fast forward. Uh, we've done really well.</p>
<p>You know, suddenly there are maybe a thousand people buying our products that has different concerns around how we store data, how we process it. Um, the kinds of challenges we might run into when we do that, you know, so we're suddenly like, oh, actually we need some systems around this. And, um, maybe there's some challenges with, um, let's say our, our advertising data where it's only targeting particular people.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, that's causing other people not to get equal access to our services. That's a problem, you know? So you're then kind of in a deontological phase where you're, you're starting to have. Um, structure around it, you know, um, and, and a larger business, you probably have a lot of internal infrastructure around this already.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily have to come from the outside, but also, um, public perception can be hugely, hugely impactful in these cases as well, because, you know, um, you never want your business to be losing, I think Facebook lost something like 5% of its value the other day. Um, that kind of thing. I mean, they got it back really quickly, so they don't care, you know, and I keep banging on about them mostly because they really have been in the news a lot lately.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that's kinda the point is it, isn't just about regulation. It's about any kind of pressure that is systematic, that can then have an impact on the way that those decisions are made. Yeah. A couple of great points there. Let me repeat them back to make sure that I got it. So, number one, it, it is all of the pressures that the system can apply to.</p>
<p>Um, kind of go more towards these standardized places. And then number two, we might think of this as kind of being a lot of loops. So for some specific thing, we might get to a place and then have to loop back through and loop back through and loop back through. And this is really a dynamic thing that is always happening at a bunch of different touch points.</p>
<p>Is that fair to say, okay, that is fair to say. I can see a question that's coming from Jamal around. Um, how do we ensure that ethical practices are built into machine learning and AI? Um, and again, actually, this is a really good example where that industrialization process is starting to happen. So you're starting to see, um, just like you would with any other code library, things that you can embed right.</p>
<p>In your machine learning flow process that at least claim to be, um, able to, uh, ensure the fairness of your system, um, or, or various other kinds of ethical principles of fairness, explainability, various things that are being asked of, um, they promise to do that. So I think, um, just like anything else you have to vet, whether that is really going to work in the way that you expect it does.</p>
<p>Um, but realistically, you're starting to see that some of these components are, are getting pushed down the chain as it were into a more commoditized version.</p>
<p>Excellent. Thank you. And we have another question in the Q and a, uh, this is the question that keeps this person up at night whose ethics and how might that change over time. So regulations and ethical decisions made under a regime or an administration that then change, uh, with whatever change in the regime or the administration.</p>
<p>And they specifically bring up the example of Afghanistan. Um, yeah, that's, it's a really, really fabulous question because, and I think this is part of what the kind of broader digital ethics movement is doing is essentially saying, uh, for many years, we've had, um, unquestioned ethics that benefit particular groups of people at the expense of others.</p>
<p>And how do we take a very kind of fundamental, basic human rights approach to saying that at the very basic level, if we cannot achieve fairness between people that are using these systems. These are not, um, valuable systems, but it really is. Um, like you say, um, there, there are a lot of contextual considerations that come into play.</p>
<p>Um, good and bad when you talk about things in a more localized way. So I think that's not an answer in terms of how do I solve this problem. Um, but it's certainly a question that I think is very much on the minds of people that are working in this industry and in this field. Awesome. Thank you. Uh, I'll say one final thing before I hand it over to choppy, but, uh, I would really like to see the Kaitlin Chris grand debate, maybe next year, the fireside chat at math camp.</p>
<p>Can you say, is the Kaitlin Chris big debate? Yeah, happy to do it. Always happy to have a conversation with Chris. All right. Thank you so much. And, uh, Tommy me, I'll go ahead and hand it off to you. I know you need to get in here second. Hello everyone. Can everybody hear me and see me? Fantastic. And good morning.</p>
<p>Good afternoon. We actually, sorry. I said, good morning. I realized that it's actually a good afternoon. This is like a UK based conference, or you can hear the English actually live in Chicago. Um, and I'm, I'm, I'm really excited to be here. Been working with LSA full. I've been like the avid apprentice assignments for good few years now.</p>
<p>And I really, really enjoy anything to do with mobs because it's a very different way of thinking about business and business strategy. It's not typically how organizations think. And for those of you who aren't familiar with, who I am, I work for a company called the Kraft Heinz company. So that's like Mac and cheese for those in America, Heinz beans, ketchup, mayonnaise, all those delicious food products.</p>
<p>And I'm the global head of employee digital experience. And I actually really love this conversation around data ethics and power because Caitlin, I love how you explained. Your examples were looking at an organization like vessels the world, but really what does it look like when you talk about data within an organization?</p>
<p>You know, your question on like, what keeps you up at night? For me? The thing that keeps me up at night when it comes to like ethics and particularly data is the, how do we move away from viewing employee data as something scary? And how do we actually embrace the access to data and enable people to have more, uh, like I'd say like control and autonomy over their lives, whether that's in work or in their personal lives.</p>
<p>Like, that's what I think data can do. I sincerely believe like data plus human, you will create like some, I call it like a Terminator. Um, but Muslim, some form of like bionic beings. And I think that's the thing that keeps me up at night. Just how do we move away from that? Um, I, I, when you mentioned like the bank, especially, I think data is less about.</p>
<p>How the customer perceives actually within crop times we have 40,000 employees and my customers and my employees. And in the same way, you kind of serve as a customer or consumer. And the consumer may ask like, do I want to buy this product? Well, actually employee is going to the same question, you know, do I want to work for this organization?</p>
<p>Do I want to be here? And you know, there's this big, um, Conversation around the great resignation, the great resignation national, um, I dunno, I think it's something it's causing like the great resignation. And actually there's a lot of research that says 40% of employees want to leave the company within the next three to six months.</p>
<p>But this idea that the grass is greener, but really, I think it's even more than that. I think it's employees are beginning to say, you know, I really love Maslow's hierarchy of needs. There was this need of like psychological safety. And actually once we progress or there's higher high pre through those levels of the hierarchy, we move on to people being considered people, being mindful of this idea of like, self-actualization what is my purpose?</p>
<p>Is this organization aligned to my purpose? I might in my flow. Um, and does the values of this organization aligned to like my individual goals? One of the things we look at with incorrupt times is there was previously a talk about work-life balance, which doesn't really make so much sense these days with everybody being so accessible 24 7.</p>
<p>And what does life balance look like? Um, and then when we think about life balance, like what does that harmony of the individual, the individuals, like, how does it harmoniously play into how they work? Now? The reason I'm mentioning all of these is because actually like data and the access to data and your attitude towards data and your attitudes towards like power and hierarchy and ethics play into all of this.</p>
<p>I mean, if we talk about life balance and we say, there's the holistic being the holistic employee, the a holistic individual. Well, actually then we're saying that, you know, there's no differentiation between work and life. So actually then how do we, how do we empower the employee to be flexible, mindful of how they.</p>
<p>Spend their time and how they think about work and they think about their personal lives. And how do we make sure that this there's that nice symbiotic relationship between the organization and the individual. So then what does data look like in an organization? Um, it comes from like a number of different places.</p>
<p>Um, I think it's not just about like how employees work, there's this conversation around like productivity and efficiency. Um, but really like, what is productivity and what does it mean to be efficient? You know, we can look at Microsoft tools and we can say people are logged in between these amount of hours, but actually does not mean that the employee is productive.</p>
<p>And actually, do we assess productivity as the outcome of a tangible outcome or is it the ability to enable people to be able to like fail and feel safe in failing? Katelyn. You also mentioned about the tensions between, um, authorities, where it has to be respectful, but also like adversarial and it should be respectfully.</p>
<p>So, um, when I think about a company like Kraft Heinz, which is where I am, we actually have our own internal ethics and data council. And, and I can say for sure that the relationship is like that. I really loved how you said, don't look at how you did things in the past. Unexpected apply those methodologies.</p>
<p>So things in the future, almost like, you know, all doors, all keys, can't open new doors and actually just helping educate, um, and helping understand like, what is the purpose? Um, and what is the. The need, um, for different types of data, maybe I'm talking quite vague, but I'll talk about one thing specifically.</p>
<p>Um, if we talk about this idea of this holistic being and life balance, one of the things we're really focused on is how do we empower our employees to have data about how they work almost like a Fitbit for their lives. How do we enable people to know how they, how often they reply to email? Just the visibility of how you spend your time.</p>
<p>Imagine if I was a marathon runner, I might run quick, but actually I probably should care about like how I eat, how many calories I eat. Like, how does Google. Look like in my body ever, same period of time. What's my speed. Over the same period of time, are there better times and days need to run faster the times and days where I should be resting.</p>
<p>And that's what I believe is this new empowerment of data for employees. And I think like that concept, at least at an organization, like similar to the one that I'm in is quite pioneer. It gets actually very new. It's not something that we ever really thought about. Um, and actually when we look at how that relationship works, like the ethics and data council, it again is very, very new.</p>
<p>The ethics in data counselors built up with people in HR, people Meagle and people in our security team who advocates for the employees. I want to make sure that they protect like crop times. Um, and they protect the employees. So in this particular use case of this like Fitbit for your life, which is, it's actually not a solution by Fitbit, but I'm just, I'm being conscious.</p>
<p>I don't want to like, um, Promotes and technology says user, can we describe it as a Fitbit, be alive the way we can kind of work together in that harmonious way, allowing the council to kind of challenge us, challenge us and push us in the right way is that we start with like a proof of concept where we have like a very small group run about a hundred employees out of the 40,000 we have, or we give them access to this solution.</p>
<p>We kind of let them go free reign, see if they can intuitively use it. And then we bring them back in and we'll do some education on internet, like how you can use the solution. We'll do some qualitative and quantitative feedback. Then we present it back to the ethics council and we do a pilot with a bigger population.</p>
<p>Then we'll look at like a different zone or different geographies or functions. And then we look to commercialization. And I think that at least in my experience is something that I'm recognizing to be quite new, this idea of like proof of concept, pilot and commercialization. And actually I'm not describing that in Kraft Heinz, but I think that's kind of relevant, irrespective.</p>
<p>Internal external or size of organizations. And I think that's because we also noticed there's been like a democratization of power and a democratization of data and predominantly driven out of this move towards hybrid, you know, how people were able to kind of control groups, um, and have access to information was maybe sometimes based on their physical presence or the, um, power of the resources or the power of knowledge or their positional power with an organization, which we could see at exemplified like the physical environment.</p>
<p>And now that everybody has moved virtual, it's kind of fully democratized, both power and data. And now we're trying to rebuild and understand, um, what that looks like. So I have been talking with for some time, I wonder if there are any questions or if anyone has been in our, I can just keep going. We do have a question.</p>
<p>If you have more to say, we certainly have the time for that, but we do have a question if you'd like me to read that. Should I go ahead? Sorry. My, my thing crashed caught, so I hate to say if we do have a question, I can take the question. Okay, cool. Yes. So, um, Maneesh is wondering about, uh, how ethical choices change as things evolve.</p>
<p>Uh, so you can read more in the Q and a there, if you can see that. Uh, but there are things that are fast-tracked right? Like the vaccination trials, when you've had a case where we needed to fast track that and a lot of, um, You know, attention on that regulatory attention. Um, but how does the ethical perception of certain things change depending on like where it is in, uh, the, on the timeline of evolution?</p>
<p>A fair question. So this tool I'm talking about, which is like the Fitbit for the employee's life. Actually, we've been trying to launch this for maybe about two and a half years to no success. And, and we recognize now that, Hey, okay, people are at home, people are feeling fatigued. People have gone through the change to being remote.</p>
<p>And actually now it's becoming more established. And actually now people should really have access. If you have access with a Fitbit in your personal life, you know, you can say, how long does this meal take to cook? You can see the ingredients in your, in your food. You can see how those ingredients impact your body.</p>
<p>You can, you can assess so many other things in your life and why wouldn't you do that in work? And actually the, the business case, the use case has kind of remained the same, but sometimes you need that agency, um, that comes from like an external party. And I actually think I don't actually genuinely believe that that's the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not, not now. W, sorry. Sometimes it's not, no, like NEFA, sometimes it's not just no to not now, if you get what I mean. And I think that that's, you know, there's like the idea of like importance and impact and actually something has to be both impactful and important for it to be relevant now.</p>
<p>Um, and I have no issue with like agency coming from external sources. Yeah. That's something that I feel is becoming a thread across your talk. And Caitlin's talk like the idea of a window, right? Where the things like come to the public attention or, uh, you know, start to, to gain some momentum as far as being regulated.</p>
<p>But there is the idea, I think of a window where like, you're talking about this where you want to provide employees with this data that can help them actually have a better life, a more, uh, Helpful life as an employee. I don't know what the right term would be for that, but the idea was there, but now with this big shift, like this is the window for it to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah. Even Caitlin mentioned, you know, like these whistleblowers with Facebook, they've known these things for years, but sometimes it's the time the time has to just be right. It's like anything, right. Timing plays a big fat, a big point and a big factor in life in general. Caitlin. So you can't come up and meet.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was going to, um, also jump in on many shoes question and I think there's a couple examples I can relate to that too as well. Um, so one of the people I advise as, um, uh, a chief bioethics officer at a large pharmaceutical company, and he was having a challenge where, um, you know, this is a really great example of, uh, obviously bioethics, very, very heavily regulated pharmaceuticals, heavily regulated.</p>
<p>Um, you know, as many says, um, yes, there were facts, fast track vaccine trials, but those were all really built on very, very, uh, Existing protocols for things that had already been tested. So it's not like they were really fast-tracked. It was just on top of things that had already been done. Like those had already been very, very heavily vetted.</p>
<p>Um, so this person was asking me, you know, he was saying, I really have a challenge where, um, we have these new essentially marketing people who are coming in and they would like to use patient data in ways that are much more about, partly about proactive wellness, but also partly about targeting them for particular products.</p>
<p>And he was like, you know, obviously on the scientific side, we have real concerns about the kind of harm that that could do, and we're very cautious about it. And because the data that, those groups of people who typically previously not been working in roles that were bioethics related, they'd been working in advertising companies, or they've been working in, um, selling online products or things that are less potentially harmful.</p>
<p>Let's say their, their approach to the data was very different because they. Really understand the potential harm of the kinds of data that they were using now. And so I think there's an element here around, um, not just the scale of the data that you're using, but the potential harm of the type of data that you're using and the potential impact that that has on someone.</p>
<p>And so if you think about the kind of data that topic is describing, you know, I mean, first of all, let's be honest, not every company wants to use that data in a nice way, which is what topic is describing. And I trust her completely to do things that are in the employee interest because of. Um, there are plenty of other companies that want to use the same kind of data in ways that are not geared towards the employee experience, but that are perhaps geared towards a more control based approach rather than an empowerment based approach.</p>
<p>So I think there is something around, um, it's, there's something for me around the types of data that you're using and the kinds of impact that can have on people's lives, the scale of the kind of impact that could have both on an individual, but also massively, and also the intentions of the people who are capturing that data and processing it, you know, is it for the benefit of the person that you were capturing the data about, or is it for potential adversarial relationship with that person and those questions?</p>
<p>I think, as you're thinking about these things in the kinds of systems that you're building, those are the kinds of questions that I would be asking myself. If I was having some concerns about a system that I was using or building, I think that's a fair point. And actually, I would say.</p>
<p>I think everything's still, I'd like to think that everything starts with the best of intentions. Um, and actually those are sincere questions, conversations that we have with the ethics and deeds council. They know why we want to use it, but we also need to be able to assure people why on what it will be used for, which is why we developed this proof of concept with a small population, pilot commercialization.</p>
<p>And I think that allows you to kind of like iterate quite rapidly. I really like this idea of like sprints and agility, because sometimes you can have, what is it called? Um, You be, you can become stagnant because you have so many different choices and are almost like so fearful of so many questions that you don't have an answer to, that it prevents you from moving forward.</p>
<p>But actually when we talk about the pie and I should really talk about the population, we use people actively self nominated to join the pilot. Um, these are like what we would call like digital enthusiasts. Um, but really if you guys are familiar with like Jeffrey, most innovation adoption, kind of, you know, you have your enthusiasts, you have your early and late majority, and then you have your lifeguards.</p>
<p>When it comes to testing new things, it's probably better to use that enthusiastic group. Those who are happy to try things and be to phase, those are happy to give you active feedback. And those who are happy to enable you to learn and grow and Caitlin without knowing the complexities of this scenario.</p>
<p>You just mentioned my initial response based on my. Now just like years of being on the receiving end of hearing, like, no, you need to do this. No, you need to do that. I've always been sort of confidence in this small pilot, small, sorry, the small proof of concept group, no more than like a hundred people.</p>
<p>I mean, based on a population size. So a manageable group that your, your team can, can have that like intimate relationship with who can help you learn. And you can give you that direct insight and you can really help you build a business case. Sometimes we just intuitively feel like I'm saying Fitbit for your life, but maybe the rounds he has at the end of all of this, um, testing that it just doesn't work in the business environment.</p>
<p>And it might not be that it will never work. It might just be that it doesn't work today, but you kind of need to go hand in hand with. Willing participants and then slowly tweak and tweak and tweak and tweak because when it comes to something like data, it is very sensitive. And you know, a friend of mine is an engineer and she said to me, toppy, you know, I love it.</p>
<p>I actually said, I really like it when a consumer will use something I've designed in the way I intended them to, but I love it when they use it in a way that I didn't even think of. And that reminds me a lot of like the projects that we run in the attacks or the experiments that we run sometimes it's great when people use it in the way we intended, but it can be scary, especially when it comes to data.</p>
<p>If somebody uses it in a way that we totally did not imagine whatsoever. And I say scary, just because it's kind of like unknown. So again, I think that proof of concept pilot commercialization it, it's almost like a funnel, so think small and going big and it helps you define your objective. Sometimes you start with a problem.</p>
<p>And actually wait, how you think you're going to resolve that problem is very different than how you actually go about doing that in my experience. And actually transparently with something like data. I don't ever know if we will ever get to a stage where it becomes so like commoditize, and it's just, I don't know if data will ever become something so rigid and structured in that way.</p>
<p>I think it may just be something that we are continually iterating with because actually, no, we have access to so much more data than we can probably consume than we actually know what to do with. And I think Kate, let me, can we split the idea of like principles, biases, rules, like principles as an approach to data, as opposed to like strict rules.</p>
<p>And maybe that gives us the flexibility and fluidity, but sorry, you you're going to say something. No, I just think those are excellent points. And we're getting tons of questions in the chat kind of building on these points. Um, one of the questions that I was wondering about as well, uh, how do you ensure data security and, uh, I guess be transparent with folks about internal usage at the data and external usage of the data.</p>
<p>Like I personally have been in situations where Mackenzie comes in and collects a bunch of data. And I feel like I don't have a say in that, but I don't want a company like McKinsey profiting off of me.</p>
<p>For example, we are all in a zoom call now, maybe zoom would kind of anonymize the data, but really they probably are able to pull some statistics where they say these types of people join these calls with these other types of people over this period in time. And they'll probably be able to kind of take some sentiment out of the fact that we were using that total.</p>
<p>It's just even like, if this was Microsoft teams, Microsoft would also be able to do the same. That's how they're able to pull up like all of these, um, statistics so they can see how populations come together. And I think we just have to get a little bit comfortable with that. Um, if we want to use the tool and, um, this is like on a macro level that I'm going to go smaller.</p>
<p>At least it gives me comfort. I mean, I joined zoom and I joined him to speak at conferences. I joined zoom to actually work out. I joined some tough calls of my family because I'm in Chicago, they're in the UK. Um, I've treat zoom for multitude of different. Cases, I'm trying to solve in my own personal life.</p>
<p>And I recognize that with access to like technology and I'm this like democracy democratize technology, right. Where I can, I can pretty much meet anybody anywhere in the world at any time, as long as I'm willing to be awake at that time. I also recognize them. There's like the risk and there's also the, well, there's the reward, but there's also kind of like the risks of that.</p>
<p>Um, and I think maybe there's something about like, education, I'm feeling comfortable with that. Um, because sometimes you can have this idea of like mock bureaucracy. You know, I, I feel is a way that it actually isn't and I think we need to be like, The bit that, but at least I think about my own personal, because I need to be comfortable.</p>
<p>I'm fully having my eyes open in terms of what that means when it comes to using in an, in a business context. And those are exactly the same questions that the ethics and data comes to us. They say, well, this data leave the company, or Willie w will be joined something external where we can't bring the data into the company.</p>
<p>We can't protect it or will it leave the company. And actually right now, the most comfortable places that nothing should really like be the company that has anything to do with employees. And I think that's fair and relevant. Um, I hope that answers the question. I don't even, I guess my action, my response is it depends, but I think there's a big part of education.</p>
<p>Um, and I think education through transparency right now, we don't really actually know who use it. I mean, if I go to the doctors and I get a vaccination, where do they take that information? Where did my medical records go? What if I don't, if I go to Starbucks and I pay on my Starbucks app, like what data does Starbucks get from me using the app?</p>
<p>So there's probably like a degree of comfort that we need to have just as we evolve in general. But there's also like a, another degree of transparency. And I have to Caitlin's earlier point, I think things like Facebook by choice by folks, we will begin to get that transparency. Yeah. I would love to see a world where employers, especially large employers who are collecting data about their employees.</p>
<p>They were using their position as employers to educate employees about how data is collected and which touch points and what that data is used for, you know, and create more literacy around that. But a girl can dream. Right. Um, the, uh, another question that kind of builds on that is, uh, how do you employ.</p>
<p>Opt-in or opt out of data collection in the workplace. Very good point. And actually we have an opt in model. I mean, so right now we on this with this proof of concept people opt in, but the idea is when we commercialize it, we very much Upton and it will be very quick. We will do a huge campaign in terms of what this will be useful and what this will not be useful.</p>
<p>If anything changes how we communicate that we are taking this incredibly seriously. It's not, I mean, I'm saying it's not a, it from my experience, it is really, really very serious. And I think it's important for people to be able to opt in. You should have the choice, right? I mean, I like, so my background is in behavioral science.</p>
<p>I like the idea of things being automatic. I like the idea of things being like made me opt out. So, you know, cause you have, um, for example, it becomes like your pension or like organ donations. If people are able to opt out, then you tend to have better. Um, Like consumption of whatever the thing you're trying to do is, but in this case, especially when it's very new, it's very different.</p>
<p>Um, it can feel a little bit scary. It's something going to be an opt in and to ask the question on how employees opt in, even the process to opt in is not just, it's not, it's not almost like, you know, when you sign up for our newsletter and they said, untake they so take this. If you want to get more, it's not something hidden within that.</p>
<p>It's a very intentional opt in process going through very intentional, um, process, which really makes it very clear. It's very, it's not even going to be an automatic habit thing. You have to be very, very intentional. And it's very clear how you will opt into that. Yeah. I love that. Making it highly conspicuous.</p>
<p>At least to start. Yeah. Wonderful. Okay. I, I think we're going to get into more discussions of power, but there is a question right now in the chat about power and about the statement that you made talking about the democratization of power. In some regards, as we transitioned to a remote setting, uh, what types of power or, uh, sources of power were you referring to?</p>
<p>Sure. I think, um, mainly mostly like positional power. So I really liked, there were like four dimensions of power. I think it's Luke. Um, I think it's evenly who talks about the four dimensions of power. He talks about like positional power. He talks about resource power. He talks about like expert power and then he talks about like Reverend power.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think, I think actually the two main types of power that I've seen haven't gone, but they've just changed in terms of how we think about them is festival positional power, because actually we are all in zoom. If you put everyone in gallery view everyone's grid as the same everyone's voice is like the same volume.</p>
<p>It's kind of awkward. If someone starts talking over somebody, I cannot, can you tell how tall I am? I could be five for two. I could be like six foot two. You can't really tell. Um, and those types of things that people were able to physically show even like symbols of power status or power symbols. Right?</p>
<p>So like a car jewelry, uh, clothing, um, Kind of subtle cues to power that we just, we just knew and they were just there and we just kind of like subconsciously consumed they've changed. And I actually think that's quite interesting because maybe people who would use the positional power or the sorry, like the position or like physical power and the older in a more physical environment, it doesn't really work in this type of environment.</p>
<p>And actually within that, I actually didn't think, I think it's festival has been a leveling of the playing field, but as it began to mature, I've also noticed. It's kind of shifted. Some people have been able to switch and evolve and others haven't. So for example, it's very clear. Um, like if you look at everybody's background here I am in an office, you know, someone who does everybody have like an office.</p>
<p>Does everybody have like pat, you've got your whiteboard behind you? Like, they've been new statements of power have suddenly changed and like how you present yourself to the world and how you're perceived by the world have suddenly changed. Um, and then even when I think about like expert power and in the, if I, if I double-click into expert power, what I mean about that is how do you communicate in a virtual environment?</p>
<p>How do you. Influence in a virtual environment. It's no longer that I can test that. Tell someone let's go for dinner. Let's go for a drink. You want to go for a coffee? Well, no, it's changed. Um, and actually again, then when I think of that type of Paula has definitely even democratized too. We can even look at resource power, maybe a silly example.</p>
<p>Maybe there was somebody in your office. Actually, I say a silly example, but it was suddenly running Kraft-Heinz it's real. Um, when it came to like monitors or access to like technology, like new technologies or even, uh, um, like memorabilia, like things people would well like branded memorabilia in the physical environment.</p>
<p>If someone had access to those types of resources they had at a certain level of power. Well, that doesn't really mean anything in these days. Like what does that new power symbol look like? Is it that you have access to new technologies that make your virtual experience enhance versus one of your basic maybe like your peers or anybody else.</p>
<p>And those are, I guess, to answer the question, those are the different shifts in power that I'm talking about. That's what I feel like it was the leveling of the playing field and then actually the rebuilding of new expressions of power. Yeah. Yeah. I there's been so many interesting things about working exclusively, exclusively, remotely, but I did I, a few months ago I was talking with, uh, you know, fancy executive person or whatever.</p>
<p>And I think of those people as being like, yeah, let's get back in the office so that I can be in my corner office and, you know, show how much space I take up and those kinds of things. And he said, I just want to stay like this forever. Cause I'm super short and no one knows it's true. Okay.</p>
<p>Very funny. Like, I, I, it just never even occurred to me, but yeah, so many really interesting things. And I know I can jump into another example around that as well. Um, so I also did a huge chunk of research around the shifting ways that our working environments are changing as a result of being more distributed.</p>
<p>Um, that has a little bit of an ethics component, but it wasn't really fully about that, but it is really a lot about power. And, um, one of the interviewees that, um, we had for that said, um, it's really different having town halls now, you know, they used to all be in the auditorium. They were really far away.</p>
<p>They were in the dark. I couldn't see them, you know, they'd have to really be brave to lift their hand and ask questions. And now they're all right here in my face and they are not shy about asking me questions about things that are going on. So for them it really was a democratization, you know, but I also think it's worth acknowledging that it hasn't been an equal playing field for everyone.</p>
<p>And as topic has said, It really it's, it's shifted a lot of things. And for some people that's gotten a lot worse, so there's definitely been a change, um, that we have to acknowledge for sure. Uh, this, this also interests me a lot. I have to say, I used to work in, uh, opt-in surveillance technology. That was, that was an area that I was in for years and years.</p>
<p>And you learn a lot about what people, what people care about. It's really where you cannot predict what people will want you to record and not want your record it's as it's entirely about what the payoff is for them. So I have people who would quite happily send me, um, reams of, um, of their porn history.</p>
<p>If they really wanted me to fix a problem with their things so that they could do their time sheets, because actually they really cared about something that automatically sorted their time sheets out for them. They didn't really care if I stole their porn history. So it's kind of, it's very, it's very specific, but I mean, my myself I'm, I love being observed.</p>
<p>I totally love being there. Uh, a big part of that. Is, um, well, I have multiple sclerosis, so ill, quite a lot. Am I need to have information will help me be better in future. And it's amazing how, um, Google and Amazon went through a period where they would say, oh, you know, have you thought about reading this book?</p>
<p>Because people with you buying history really, really liked reading this book. And it's been incredibly useful for me to have that they've actually stopped doing it. Cause I think they got in trouble for it, for, uh, intrusiveness in the, and you know, because it's quite obvious from the book that they'd been able to deduce a little footnote about my, my personal situation, but it was really useful stuff.</p>
<p>And I really regretted that they stopped doing it. Uh, I think you cannot judge for other people what information they are willing to give away because you don't know what they care about. So yeah. So you have to be careful not to assume that other people have the same values that you do. Everyone's quite different.</p>
<p>Such a great point. Thank you so much. And I know we have other questions in the chat, but I do want to get to and talk. And many, she has been a superstar asking so many good questions all day, so I will get to those questions Maneesh, but, and, uh, I will go ahead and hand it over to you if that's okay. It is right.</p>
<p>Well, I will attempt to, um, hopefully share my application and get it right.</p>
<p>Excellence.</p>
<p>Right. Can you see that? All right. Um, I'm going to assume that excellence gets right. Uh, so I feel a little bit bad about my talk because it's not quite as, quite as, as, uh, as aligned as the two previous as, um, as, as toppy and, um, Caitlin talks, but, uh, hopefully, hopefully it'll, it'll be interesting. So I liked it in the tech industry for nearly 30 years now.</p>
<p>And, um, uh, and I've been able to lots of interesting things such as, uh, opt-in surveillance software. Um, but at the moment I'm interested in green software and changing people's behavior in the industry, in the tech industry to, to be more aware of climate and or how that might change the behavior. So my interest at the moment is about how you change behavior, how you.</p>
<p>Uh, how society can adapt to a really very radical change, how at the soft society in the tech industry and therefore is other things that we can learn from that about, uh, about the, uh, about society in general, more generally. And I don't really like to talk about climate and ethics in the same track, um, because it, because it kind of implies that being green and climate is, is about ethics.</p>
<p>And it's not, it's just risk management. This is, this is a pure safety of society issue. It's not really an ethical issue anymore. Um, but, uh, but I have to, I have to communicate it quite a lot and I have to, um, to talk about and try and persuade people. So, uh, so power and ethics, they all do. And, uh, dynamics do all play into this.</p>
<p>Uh, and I recently got involved with something called the green software foundation. And I was, I was sucked into this foundation because, um, they really, they, they presented their vision with the delay grab and, uh, I do, I do love it to Les brown. So it's, uh, I, I work from home for years and years, um, a long time before the pandemic.</p>
<p>And like, generally I really, really like working from home, but there's something that I missed about working from home. And that is a whiteboard. I do love being in that office during things on the whiteboard and diagram, straps are fantastic for that. Uh, and this is pretty good diagram that outlines all the things that we want people to do as we agreed.</p>
<p>And once we tell but efficient to that means being energy efficient and hardware efficient and aware of, of how much carbon you're using depending on the time of day and all that kind of stuff. So this is quite a nice at least diagram. Um, but I'm very aware it's not a map. Um, Now, I'm not, as I said, I'm not an expert in mapping, but I, I, I wanted to try and learn a little bit about how I might communicate this message more in a more contextually aware way than just saying, um, it's an efficient energy efficient and hardware fishing carbon away.</p>
<p>I go, just go away and switch it out. You know, what are people gonna, what are people gonna be convinced by? What are people going to be resistant to? What's easy for them to do. What's difficult for them to do so. I really wanted to try and get and see this, not just as a diagram, but as, as a map. So I kind of did my first ever, ever map, um, which, uh, and, um, trying to put down all the things that I thought in the tech industry, this shouldn't it, although this isn't, the tech industry is pretty general user stuff.</p>
<p>Um, you know, Um, machine learning and use the devices and the cloud. And, um, what's already carbon efficient software, high performance software, which I used to work in before I worked in surveillance software. I used to work in high-performance software, um, which in high software and carbon efficient software, uh, very similar.</p>
<p>You, you, you kind of look to be efficient in how you're using electricity, uh, by doing less stuff. And actually, if he wants to be high performance, you want to run more quickly. You want to do less stuff. So by, by chance they happen to be very similar. So I, sorry, really quickly. We are not seeing a map.</p>
<p>We're just seeing a blank slide. Oh, right. Okay. Um, so I can see it. Well, let me go back. Can you see the diagram again? Yes. Green software carpet efficient. Okay, cool. I'll try moving on to the slide again. Yes. There is the map, right. Excellence. Right. Um, so I've talked to you a little bit, actually. Maybe it's not so bad because I've told you about the kind of things that are on the map, and then I can show you the map and you can see that it's, it's quite interesting cause that's, um, there's a lot of stuff over to the rights in the kind of commoditized and becoming more commoditized areas, which is, which is the cloud, which is something that Simon talks about a lot as being very commoditized.</p>
<p>And then you've got a load of stuff on the left, which is actually where traditionally all the green software there, the, the carbon efficient software, you. Things like, and softwares, which tends to be very custom built. Now, the scary thing about this map, as soon as I wrote it, it CA it became quite obvious.</p>
<p>The scary thing about this map is that all the things we need, like high performance software and all the techniques and software efficiency tools are on the, on the left. And that's not mostly because of a new just appeared. And nobody's been thinking about them. Um, they've been on the left over here for my entire career.</p>
<p>I mean, it was the nineties when I was on for and software. And it was an ex non-exec exactly the same position of this map that as it is now, it's not moving right at all. So when I want to go and tell people to write green software and to think about software efficiency, I'm telling them to do something which is resolutely custom built.</p>
<p>So, um, So it's likely to be really quite likely to be quite resistant to that because it's gonna be difficult. Um, it's, you know, writing my performance software has traditionally always been very difficult. It's been, um, tricky skills, not many people have that kind of thing. And, and, and things haven't changed.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a few, there's a few stuff coming up that where people are a bit more aware of it. Like you don't want either wants apps that drain your user device, but that isn't really about choosing apps that are incredibly efficient. That's about not choosing apps that are terrible and instantly drain your, your device.</p>
<p>So it's kind of, there's a slight awareness there, but it's not really good enough. It's just kind of the bare minimum. So, um, so I was, I was worried about this, but I thought I drawing some more lines between things so that I could get a feel for, um, for. But how will list up Mike might fit together? And this is a recent, I, I did the usual thing of doing an enormously complicated map with thousands of things on it.</p>
<p>Then I realized that it wasn't really helping me to visualize the thing. So I took out some stuff that I thought was somewhat extraneous. Um, and you might need to go back to slide forward or something like that again. Okay. I'll do, I'll go back. I'll go forward. That's Chromebooks for you. They don't really play very excellent.</p>
<p>Good. Um, Yes. So, uh, so I put a line here. I have to say, I have not used maps very much, but I did find this really very useful. It really made me think about the problem in quite a different way and see linkages that I wouldn't otherwise have seen. So I'm, I'm quite, I'm not quite sold on my thing as a result of doing this.</p>
<p>Um, the, when I started to link things up, it was kind of, as I was of imagining in my head, most of the stuff that carbon efficient software, all the things that related to it were on the left-hand side of the, of the charts, high performance software for efficiency tools, um, used devices and device power management.</p>
<p>But then I realized there is one and that's all in the stuff. That's, that's not very easy for people to use, not a, not a very easy sell, but there is one thing that links carbon efficient software to. To the kind of things that are going on in the cloud that are very popular at the moment. So sports instances, if you're not in the tech industry, you probably won't be so aware of them.</p>
<p>But, um, the cloud is actually really quite carbon efficient. It's quite good. Uh, because it it's because they care about that because it's, that's part of their cost of goods is how much electricity they use and how many machines they use and how many machines they throw away when they didn't really need to.</p>
<p>I gotta stop. It is important to them, so they care, but mostly users don't care and that kind of stopped and really exposed it to users who were using cloud products. Um, but there, and most users who use count cloud products use something called on demand instances. So it's not, you don't use machines in the cloud and use something called virtual machines.</p>
<p>Uh, and most people use these virtual machines that all the time they say I'll have a virtual machine and I'll just use it all the time. And that's the, that's the vast majority of use, but there's another kind of virtual machine called a spot virtual machine. And that the spot virtual machines offered jobs, the tar.</p>
<p>Uh, The cloud providers like them because they, um, they, because they can be moved around, they can be shifted around. Uh, they don't have to run any particular time. They're quite flexible. Uh, cloud providers can use them to, when they've got a bit of space space, a bit of slack in the system, they go well, stickers, proper spot instance.</p>
<p>And that makes make a little bit of money running the spot instance. And then when it's finished, we'll take it out and use it for, for these on-demand instances. Again, it helps the cloud providers to increase something called their server utilization. So it means that they use their machines more efficiently within that cloud, uh, which helps them to cut the cost or operating the cloud or, or improve the revenues.</p>
<p>It's kind of like selling your, um, um, uh, selling you kind of you're you're off cuts or something. It's, it's something that they didn't really plan. It's where they've got extra spare capacity. They weren't using for anything else they'll sell. They'll sell to use this. But, but because sports instances can be moved around and they increase efficiency that they're actually really good for green something for writing green software.</p>
<p>And they are basically one of the few things that link carbon.</p>
<p>I think we're having a little bit of trouble with the audio.</p>
<p>Anne. Are you still there? Okay, cool. Sorry, it just cut out for a few seconds. Oh, all right. Uh, that was cause I, I switched slides, which obviously it doesn't like, uh, can you see my new slide? It's just blank. All right. I just meant I'm going to switch back and forth again. Okay. Yep. There it is. Evolutions.</p>
<p>Excellent. Excellent. So this is where I, I, um, I get to introduce to this map because the old map. What's going on, it's kind of static, but things from the left went wrong, really moving things from the right, moving slowly, uh, for the cloud is moving, moving slowly, even further. Right. But, but it's not a massively changing situation, but actually in, in climate, we've got, we have actually got a really quiet, especially in tech, a really quite fluid situation at the moment because there are two, um, there are teleological and dams, logical factors coming in very quickly to change what's going on in our industry and, and how we, as people within our industry will have to behave.</p>
<p>But they're just kind of hinting at how society in general is going to be affected by climate change and how we're going to have to behave or how we're going to have to change our behavior. Um, but on the technological side, we've got something called zero carbon we've got, and didn't change sides that she cut out for me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if she cut out for anyone else. Oh, my, can you hear me? Yep. Ah, excellent. So, so, oh, well I'll quickly rejigger what I just said, but the, the, the situation is changing. We've got new Telia illogical and Optivia logical, and Dan's logical factors coming in, changing the landscape here, changing our map landscape, um, teleological in 2020, all of the three big cloud providers who are the biggest companies in the world, uh, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft announced something really radical, which very few people have picked up on, but it's going to completely change our lives over the next decade, which is that they committed that they would run all the cloud based, which is basically by 2030.</p>
<p>It will be all of software. All of, all of the tech industry competency, zero by 2050. And, uh, that's an unbelievably difficult goal. It's not some airy fairy, um, uh, carbon neutral goal. It's, it's genuinely producing no carbon as a result of running their operations, which sounds like it wouldn't like it would be plausible.</p>
<p>They could run everything off, um, wind and solar and all that kind of stuff. But actually it's, it's considerably tougher than that. And it will require quite a lot of change to the way that we use that. So coz handed handed, so that's totally illogical. They didn't have to do it. They're very, although you might, you might say they were just imagining a future in which it will be legally required for them, which I think there'll be sensible to imagine certainly coming, but it's not legally required for them now.</p>
<p>So they're being a little bit visionary that they're saying this is the right thing to do and we'll do it. Um, we've also got some things that clearly there's a logical that are very, very close to it now, uh, that are coming very, very soon. Uh, and that is the move away from high availability power to variable power.</p>
<p>So, uh, it's almost a cliche that power is in the bottom right-hand side of all Wardley maps, but I'm going to say that power's about to split into two. High availability power, which is what we used to get all the time from fossil fuels to variable, very variably available power, which is a solar power and wind.</p>
<p>So we get so that when it's sunny and we get wind when it's windy and if it's not, we don't get as much power and suddenly power goes up in price considerably. Uh, and that's going to affect the cloud a lot. So, and everybody who runs, um, tech products in practice is going to affect every industry very significantly that suddenly how will will be cheaper sometimes the day and more expensive by the times of the day.</p>
<p>If we start to add those, the lines for these new variable pricing, variable power into our map, they all converge on these spots instances that, that the cloud providers invented for completely different reasons should just save themselves money and get better utilization on the. Um, but they fit in very well with this idea that sometimes you want to run stuff and sometimes you don't want to run stuff that, um, some things are really urgent and some things are important, but urgency and importance, uh, not identical.</p>
<p>And when I started to look at this and I started to look at this map, you know, urgency and importance are not identical. It's absolutely cast me back in mind. So I've just switched slides. Did this, did that work looks good? I cool. Uh, it switched me back because I'm quite old compared to, oh, although I'm going to guess a lot of people in map.</p>
<p>And there were, most of those videos appear to be about the key to being an organized manager is that you knew the difference between urgency and importance. That's everything that is important is not necessarily urgent and everything that's urgent is not necessarily important. And over the past 20 years, that that's kind of, um, changed we've, we've kind of moved to, to, uh, a way of managing where we just manage everything as surgeons.</p>
<p>And that has been quite effective for us. Terribly reliant on power being high availability and cheap. And the next 10 years, particularly, maybe in 20 years time, we're going to have really good batteries. And we won't worried about this anymore, but for the next decade, I think we're going through a period where that's not going to be the case.</p>
<p>We aren't going to have power on demand and we aren't going to have to change the way you behave. So, um, yes, this is, this is the thing that I need to be to, to, to be moving people over to. And then I kind of want your ideas on how we do this. Is this, is this something that's saleable? Uh, we've spent so long, uh, commoditizing, high availability power and to commoditizing and making all of society work around the assumption of high-availability power 10.</p>
<p>We go back to that world of urgency and importance and not the same thing. So yeah, now. I've uh, I've kind of got to the end of the bit. I want to talk about, so does anybody have any, any thoughts, questions, ideas, suggestions.</p>
<p>I have a question. That is a selfish question,</p>
<p>but surely, and with that presentation about power electricity, and also ethical concerns that go along with that. But how do you feel about Bitcoin? Oh God, it's awful. It's just awful. It's like the last hurrah of, um, of, of a world in which no one, which everybody just assumed that power was free, you know, it's it's yeah.</p>
<p>It's I. I, I just do think it's the last hurrah. So it kind of reminds me of, um, of, of the witch trials in 1640 in the 1640s in the, in the UK, there was a famous spates of witch trials of, um, uh, somebody called the, the witch find a general, um, Mo. Um, Matthew Hopkins. He didn't live very far from where I live.</p>
<p>Uh, and that suddenly there was a massive, oh my goodness. Me let's burn all the witches right now. Uh, but it was, it was at the end of all that it was the ed people, mostly people didn't really believe in, which is that at that, you know, that he was Hopkins was operating at the same time that Isaac Newton was three years old.</p>
<p>We were, we were at the, at the beginning of the enlightenment, it felt like the witch trials were the last hurrah of stupid thinking. Uh, and, uh, and it was then after that everybody just went, oh, for God's sake, we're never going to do this again. This guy should just be, everyone should just be, looks up and stopped being suits, such idiots.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, Um, I feel that it's, that Bitcoin is, is being met last hurrah or people who haven't accepted that the world has changed. That's the equivalent of burning witches at stake. Yeah, it is interesting for me because it's the, the intersection right. Of power, like electricity and power, like other kind of power, right.</p>
<p>Because that's like, um, it, it assumes, oh, your power is derived from it. Like extracting as much as you can from your fellow man and from the environment. So, yeah. I also hate Bitcoin. The interesting thing about Bitcoin is that it isn't necessarily urgent when you, when you mined Bitcoin, you could mine your Bitcoin when the power is in 10 years time, whether it be time when power is basically free, you could mind you a Bitcoin that, and then it kind of things.</p>
<p>Well then it's not really, how has that proof of work anymore? It depends what time you mind debt. And so you're not really proof of work, cause it just depends what time you mind. Um, which is just a reminder that Bitcoin is a religion and not an actual economic model because the underlying briefing book thing, it just makes no sense that in the, in a, in the near future will not make no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Katelyn. You want to weigh in on that at all. You can clearly see my spark cat and I feel it. So if you are on this call and you bought some Bitcoin and you really believe in it, Please weigh in because I'd be really interested to hear a legitimate case for either Bitcoin or in fact, blockchain that genuinely cannot be achieved with existing systems that we already have.</p>
<p>So here's an example where you're thinking about the Teeling logical versus the, or in fact, the industrialized versus the, um, the novel case. And I'm like, actually, if I need a database of things and that it's really secure and I understand how the transactions have happened, we have that. Um, and secondly, and do you mind going on mute?</p>
<p>I'm getting a little bit of an echo. Thanks. Um, and, uh, in fact, I was on a, again, I was at this other finance conference earlier today and there was somebody pointing out, Hey, you know, if you have a transaction that you accidentally sent too much money to someone, um, and there are real economic cases of this happening in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Um, you know, in, in the existing banking system, it's hard to get that back, but it's not impossible. You can usually prove that it went wrong in a Bitcoin scenario. You actually can't get that back. And if you send it, you just have to beg them to send it back to you. Basically, it's the only case that you have.</p>
<p>And it's like, well, that's the opposite of what I wanted in a trust-based system. So, um, so yes, I have many thoughts, including the climate ones and also other generally other generally thoughts around this, which is why I'm asking marketing. So.</p>
<p>In many ways I'd hate NFTs even more. Yes, I would agree with you that, that is, I mean, you know, you can get into a whole question about economic, bubbles, Ponzi schemes, um, you know, various other things where you kind of look at, look at history and say, Hey, do you remember when we all had that thing about tulips and then the Dutch economy collapsed?</p>
<p>Um, maybe let's look at that and then see how that applies to now. So, yeah, thing is, I, I quite liked your lips. I feel there's moments of value that I think everyone likes to look down. We just don't want to pay like a budget and dollars for them. And I feel the same way about gifts that I could save myself without paying any money.</p>
<p>Do you want to weigh in on Bitcoin and or to. I liked your lips similar to Anne. I think they're beautiful. The Bitcoin conversation is probably not one that I'm going to feel too comfortable getting involved in. I think it's, I like how people like to be creative and I like how people explore new opportunities to do a variety of new things.</p>
<p>And I will never stifle innovation. So whether or not Bitcoin becomes something that actually sticks, I hope that it triggers something else in the future. And for that reason, um, I can always be an of anything. Can you very diplomatic. I'm going to say I will quite gladly stifle innovation if it's harmful to people.</p>
<p>And in this case, I think that it is harmful to people. Certainly for the future of the climate,</p>
<p>but I feel like it's really important though, to address that point because so often people think that digital ethics is like just stopping people from innovating. And actually a lot of digital ethics really is about, um, look at the harms that you have in society now. And if you don't make choices about those things, what are you willing to put up with that you are willing not to change?</p>
<p>And that can really be an innovation driver. And there are some other ways that it can be a driver as well. So if you think about things like, um, in a broader principle, okay. And actually financially, this is demonstrable. If you have a more diverse team, you will have more innovation in your team. So that has a financial impact on you.</p>
<p>And there are many studies that have shown this particularly one by McKinsey, I think about 10 years ago. Um, and it's, it's really important to think about that because, um, so often people are accusing digital ethics of being this field of trusted, like just stifle innovation. And actually it's like, well, no, what we're saying is we want more perspectives in the room.</p>
<p>You know, we want more people to be more involved in the process of creating the things that we all use. And if we have that, we actually will have more innovation.</p>
<p>Yes, there's a book. I can't it's Scott Page, but I think it's Scott Page, but, uh, I can't remember the name of the book. I'll look it up and post it in the chat, but about the types of diversity and the impact that they have based on the problem. Well, I'm knocking stuff over on my desk. You should see my desk right now.</p>
<p>It's just like all coffee and tea. And because I've been up since midnight moderating, but anyway, um, yes, so different types of diversity are relevant in different problem spaces. And that's really interesting. And of course I have to use this opportunity to plug the book, epistemic injustice by Miranda Fricker.</p>
<p>Uh, for me, that has been one of the most, um, just inspiring and insightful books that I think I've ever read, especially when it comes to innovation. Uh, because the whole thing is basically. Where does the best kind of innovation come from? It comes from the epistemic margins, right? People who are alienated by the current system eliminated from their own lived experience.</p>
<p>Right? And so if we can go to folks who are marginalized by the existing system and say, in which ways is this, uh, not serving you, right. That's where great transformative innovation can come from. So highly recommend that book and highly recommend going out and trying to find the people who are underserved.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right? Because it's often very difficult to articulate how you're underserved or sometimes even to recognize that you're underserved because it's just a fact of your life. Uh, but highly recommend that. And our lovely, uh, platform support person has just informed me that we only have five minutes left.</p>
<p>So I would love to get some key takeaways from each of you that panelists, I, I have pages and pages of notes, so I'm not even sure that I'm ready to have one key takeaway, I guess. Uh, but Caitlin, if you don't mind, I'll pass it to you first. Sure. So, um, my key takeaway is, uh, again, you are not alone in being concerned about these issues.</p>
<p>There is a large and growing movement of people who really care about digital ethics. Um, there's a large and growing body of tools, both kind of, um, in a design thinking, um, informal way. And in a more formalized, here are some procedures that you can adopt or here some regulations you might want to be party to kind of a way, um, or here are some standards that you can adhere to through Tripoli and through other standards, bodies that will help you think about these issues.</p>
<p>And so, um, don't feel like you're alone or that you don't have any resources because they're, they're definitely out there for you.</p>
<p>Who wants to go next?</p>
<p>So, uh, what would I take away from this? I, uh, I, I'm very struck by, uh, I was very struck by a toppy section in the middle talking about. Giving people stuff and empowering them to make decisions about what data you store, what you do for them. What, and, um, educate and listen. And don't, don't assume, you know, you, you, you just don't know what people are going to need, or we're going to want, try it, listen to them and, and, and work with it.</p>
<p>Perfect. Thank you. Well done that. I would just say, give yourself the upper, I don't know. They always say, how do you announcement one by at a time? And I think that's the same way. When I think about approaches to bringing data into new environments, just start small, learn in scale. There's nothing wrong with iterating.</p>
<p>In fact, you probably go quicker when you start small and you build bigger rather than spending so much time planning launch, and it fails, or it doesn't deliver what you thought. So haven't feel confident in the ability to like start small and scale.</p>
<p>Wonderful. Great takeaways. Thank you all so much for being here on this panel. As you know, I've been looking forward to it for months and it totally lived up to my expectations. So I'm just very grateful. I am going to pop over to the lounge area in the square window chat, uh, for the next few minutes in between sessions.</p>
<p>And, uh, hopefully keep the conversation going over there. And if any of you panelists or any of you audience members would like to join, uh, that would be very welcome. I feel like there's still a lot more to say. So, uh, thank you all so much. And I think our next session. Pull it up. The next one is going to be me versus we, and that will be the final like track session of the day before we go to the fire side chat.</p>
<p>So I hope to see you all there. Thank you so much panelists and our wonderful audience. Thank you. Wish new one for rest of the session. Bye.</p>
