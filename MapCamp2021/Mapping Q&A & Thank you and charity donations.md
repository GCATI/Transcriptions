# MapCamp 2021 - Mapping Q&amp;A &amp; Thank you and charity donations

Oh, Chris.

That is said recording in progress. Uh, because I suddenly had this moment, uh, that, you know, oh, there's are we supposed to be recording these for everybody else? I didn't practice. That's the danger of giving me power, making me a co-host of anything. You know, things will go terribly, terribly, terribly wrong.

Okay. So we've got old blimey, become a lot of people joining. Fantastic. Um, now obviously this is the ask me anything Q and a type session or mapping. So, um, but people joining. There is no open questions at the moment. Please find there's a Q and a section. So if you've got questions, throw them in there.

And what personally we'll try and do is get to, uh, try and answer as many as possible. Um, and on top of that, you know, if you I've also been chat so I can see that as well. And of course we're in the round window, so I've got the round window chat open. Uh, so, so I'll keep an eye on that. And, um, and also there's far too many channels.

I've got Twitter open. I, my problem is I don't have enough real estate. I've only got two screens. I should have had a third. I need to get a full jester, just the load or just a plug in the back of my head. So sorry to be, if you, okay. So, um, Chris, uh, where should we start? Oh, we've had one. Have you applied China mapping to politics, EEG Brexit, all than Ireland protocol and check.

Gosh. Oh, now that's really interesting. So, so the answer, um, I used, uh, mapping itself to look at, uh, different competition between different nations states. Uh, this was many years ago, back in 20 14, 20 15. So it was looking at different, uh, lines in different industries. The automotive aeronautical industry and several others looking at the state of how evolved it was, identifying the patterns, the gameplay that China years make comparisons to, for example, the U S play, uh, the U S play was mostly market driven and not a great deal of understanding of the supply chain.

Uh, China's been playing a very gifted game of. I did find, uh, components in the supply chain during industrializing, uh, industrializing where possible use of special economic zones, that mixed market model, then moving up the stack much, much more skillful. Uh, so I, I wrote this, this, uh, particular paper, which said about.

How China is going to dominate all these stubborn areas. Uh, and, uh, and mostly it was the red by, uh, a lot of companies in the U S like, well, it's just, you know, you'll be allowed to innovate. Um, but it, it is, uh, it is, um, there has been some very skillful play. And I think the comment by the, uh, ex uh, CTO for the Pentagon, you know, China's one, the AI battle is, is pretty, uh, pretty much on the money.

I mean, But more than just, um, things like, uh, uh, the change of the, uh, the components in the system and the game play. Uh, I also got into mapping culture and see, you know, when we talk about politics between nations, um, Yeah. So when we talk about competition and competition is the act of everybody seeking together, or, you know, seeking a resource, seeking some knowledge.

This is what competition means. I mean, we can do it in several different ways. Uh, we can do it in conflict and we fight each other. We're going for the same price, but what, what beats each other up along the way? Oh, we can work together cooperation or we can leave it together, collaboration, or we can get to create something together.

So all of the. Uh, co-creation collaboration, cooperation, adjusts, strategies of competition. And often on a map, you'll use so many at the same, same time. And so, um, when you think about nation states and we're in competition, Uh, this week collaborate. Sometimes we come, uh, have conflict. Other times we often talk about it in terms of our physical sovereignty.

Here's our border in the, in, in our society, inside out border, whatever war, if necessary, uh, is our values, our behaviors, our collective, and, and sometimes that conflict spills over into people invading other people's borders and all that sort of stuff. The horror of war. But most of that is all about imposition of behaviors and values onto another geographical region.

Well, you see this sort of gameplay going on the economic world as well. Um, cause you know, conflict is like the lowest form of war. The highest. Well, it's just to persuade everybody else that they are you, and you can protect everybody else into you. It's it's the, it's the simplest way. And so we're seeing a lot of this stuff in terms of embedding of values into AI and, uh, um, uh, and, uh, um, even like video games, uh, the use of art forms to manipulate values and behaviors.

So, you know, Pride mapping, uh, do politics. You can do, uh, I've certainly done it in terms of competition. God, that was a very long-winded way of answering that question. Um, so, um, Chris, any, any thoughts on that particular subject? I think you have covered. Oh, that's very kind. It's very, very kind of you. Um, so should we pick another one?

I can tell you the next one, which is, is it usual when people start. To put too much detail on the map. Um, and from my experience from my workshops, it's pretty putting a try and what you will often see, you will see people scared of putting too many components. And what that indicates is that you haven't yet spent enough time experimenting with the reality to figure out which of those components are really important for, for your situation.

So it's perfectly normal to go. To go as deep as possible during the first pass, uh, on the, to learn later, the majority of those components weren't necessary and create a second version of a map, which will be much cleaner, much easier to digest and much easier to reuse from that point in time. But first attempts are always messy and frankly, I haven't seen.

Many people who are brave enough to share the first version of the map. What we see, what we usually see are very polished versions of representing a large or a long thinking process.

Hm. So, um, hang on a second. I'm just getting a note from Jane. Apparently there's some little issues with the Vive BFS platforms, policies for those people are actually, but yeah, I can't apologize for them. They're missing it here. Um, I, I'm just going to tell Jane there's 165 of us in the session, right? So

in the session, terrible typing on my. I find this quite funny as people say to me, um, uh, I've created a map. Uh, it's just too complicated. I mean, there's just too many components on it as well. Um, and I think it is a perfectly normal exercise of putting too much on and then taking bits off and put them on sub maps and then realizing you need a component because it's about exploration.

Um, what I, I, I'm always a little bit, um, Shall we say surprise by it is the bit where people go there's too much on the map. I can't manage it because that's the bit where you just get behind on. Those components are there, whether you, you know, they don't disappear because you decide not to look at them.

It's a bit like, oh, this is way too complicated for me to deal with this situation. Let's not do the map. It's just like, well, how else are you going to match? I mean, um, uh, you know, sometimes it's as simple as just get a bigger piece of paper. Um, most of the time it is a case of three components off, take simplify, et cetera.

So they have, so that's perfectly normal. Um, Yeah. So what I wanted to say is that this is a part of a very interesting, let's say feature. Um, because what I find is that very often you will find that there's more components that influence your situation, that you can process in, uh, in any given timeframe.

Frankly, if you were to map everything that influences your business, I have probably to create a map of the entire world, um, because something in China may be influencing your position. Sometimes this is possible. Sometimes it isn't. And one of the big questions this has been puzzling me for a really long time is whether you can manage your map.

Why is knowing that is very far from perfection and very far from listing all the important components that can adjust your business. It's like managing together a little bit of risk management. Um, Um, sort of thing, the context of the thinking and mapping, which informs the entire stuff. All right. Okay.

Okay. I mean, that's um, so let me just jump into something. Hang on a second. So I'm just going to share a screen with you. So Chris, can you see that? Okay. A title of fuel online worldliness. So, um, we started off with a component, which is the public public wants to get from a to B a to B requires them potentially.

Uh, we can use pipelines here instead, but say petrochemical, that requires us to get a garage, which. Tanker, which requires an HGV driver, which requires, you know, because they're specialists licenses C licenses, which requires an examining body DVSA, which requires component examiners, which requires.

Training. Okay. Um, now there's another component is, you know, you don't have to have, uh, uh, people getting examined. What you could do is just introduce visas, uh, and, uh, on the hope that there's a whole bunch of, uh, HTV drivers elsewhere in the world who are willing to commit. Now there's another component in here, which of course the public will on food.

And that requires raw materials. And also both of those, the food and the raw materials are quiet distribution, which is connected to the HTB drivers. Now, another thing that public requires as money, they obviously need that to buy the food, but they also get that from things like. Which possibly could be worker's needs she be driver or know, hopefully that you might get it from something like universal basic income.

If we have ever have universal basic income. And of course, on to this, we've got a component which is the business and what the business wants to do. It must get profit and it gets us profit from revenue, hopefully from selling food that we all love, or maybe not, but at the same time it has caused.

Associated with raw materials, work and distribution. And, um, you know, it has another cost which is tax, which we actually need to fund the DVSA and also UBI as well. If we ever get to UBI. Now, the point about this is this is a really soon, it's starting to already build up many, many different components.

Um, this was a group of four people just chatting, uh, for an internal, I think it was 27 minutes, uh, about, uh, fuel prices and why they were chatting. I'm sitting there typing. And the only reason why it's only this complex is because that is the speed at which I can type. I mean, it's just, cause I I'm just lousy at typing, but the thing is, I think.

But one of the things I like about that is you've got many, many different components and we can now discuss about missing components and things that not on air. We can have that sort of discussion and argument, not attacking each other, but attacking the map, saying that there's something wrong with the map or whatever.

Well, whatever else it is, we can add new components into that. But you know, this was a conversation which I had, uh, oh, I don't know, maybe a week ago. Um, and I know that I can just bring up this map or I'm getting lots of chat messages in here. Sorry, let me hide the chat messages. Yes, we've my oh God. Uh, the point is I can have this conversation about this particular space lane.

Now I can go back to it in, in, you know, six months. And just within a few minutes of looking at the map, be straight back at the conversation that I had beforehand. I do this, but, you know, we had one which is the UN reducing global poverty, which links all the way through all weather roads, all the way down to the statistics organizations and the different systems.

And, and simply, uh, by, uh, you know, just looking at that map, I can be back in the meeting where we were back in that sort of discussion. And I can't do that. With normal meetings, normal meetings. If I don't have a map, I spend at least the first identify, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, maybe trying to remember where we were in the past meeting.

And the level of detail is nowhere near the concentration. Yeah, with a map. So I understand that it's complicated. People are too much, too many terms and all the rest of it, it's very imperfect, but even in a perfect map like this, and it is very, very imperfect, I find is useful. At least moves the conversation forward.

What do you think?

Um, but there was, I mean, it's not. I'm difficult. I'm having difficulties finding the right words that are the right words, because it's not that the map is complex. It's just the inability to contain all the knowledge that influences all the components that influence a situation within an app in a reasonable timeframe, because.

I essentially expand any of those components and find there that there are like entire underlying value chains. And some of those components in those underlying value chains may be influencing your map. So you are making a trade-off, um, between the level of obstructions of components, which you are using in your map.

And I would say perceived risk that something. Inside those components below the obstruction levels will influence your map. Yeah. It's like a guest or something like that. Yeah, I agree. Uh, I mean, uh, all backs are in perfect representations of space. It's all about trade-off. I mean, um, But, you know, I can visually make a choice here.

I can decide we can, we, we can dive down into particular elements, like, you know, tax or maybe UBI or something along those lines. And we can get into a whole, you know, sort of, uh, I suppose then the question becomes, well, what about, uh, um, uh, analysis paralysis or something? Um, and that always comes up, but I look at this and I actually find this, this is, uh, uh, you know, even in this.

Imperfect as it is. I can say things like, you know, we need to be funding here. We'll talk about how we need to turn and get drivers into autonomous vehicles or whatever it happens to be. We can talk about a lot of this stuff, even with a very imperfect map. And that took the third, well, just under 30 minutes.

And most of that time, it was me scribbling down. Uh, as quick as I can, uh, cause I'm not very good at life mapping. Basically. I've got terrible hands and I'm not a pianist or I'm very, very bad at typing. All right. So we've got a whole bunch of other questions. I know. I have a terrible habit of, uh, yeah, I'm sure we, should we pick the next one in your opinion of governments, fundamentally, uh, or less able to adopt some commodity components in the private sector?

Uh, whether it be existing loans or otherwise. Okay. So you might have a different opinion to be on. I'm sure we're going to have a different opinion song, but I find it hilarious, but the reason why I find it hilarious is that, um, uh, I found duplication and wasting governments and the worst duplication I've ever found is 118 workflow systems doing the same.

So we've managed to build prisoner registration, uh, about 118 different ways. That is peanuts compared to the nonsense I've seen in the private sector. I've got a bank you've managed to build risk management over a thousand times. I mean, I've got a, a pharma company. So it might manage to about 350 different enterprise content management systems.

I mean, so the level of duplication of waste and custom building and everything else in the private sector has always, I've always found it vastly more, uh, than I found a gap. And I think it's because in government we have things like the national audit office, major projects or authority. We have some actual, uh, uh, Uh, that, uh, or some challenge that actually goes on, but in the, um, I have to say, I, I, I found a difference, um, but it's not a difference that the government is wasteful.

Private sectors is super efficient. In fact, I've found most of the private sector has incredibly wasteful. So, so my take, it would be, it all depends on which government are talking about, um, because commodity components. If you say something as a commodity, you're imply it's widely available. But if you think for example, about the U S situation with Huawei and how this affected, for example, Poland, then it's quite interesting because in government you can do CQI products because they are effectively banned.

And, um, if you think about, and the other components there is. This angle of national security. And do you may not be willing to put foreign components inside the value chains, which at some point in time may be used against you. And for example, if you think about Russia, they have practiced cutting of the entire country from the internet because they wanted to touch, they own the DNS structure, right?

This is something, this is like, this is like, where. They are actively taking a choice towards not using commodity and standard components because this will serve the safety, but is there other, again, a matter of trade-off the, and they broke their pattern, but what may be also very interesting is that, um, there is a risk associated with adoption.

If the component is early in the commodity phase, you may perceive that it's very risky and frankly, plenty of people will do so. And you may want to wait. To see, to wait for practices, to emerge around those components for those practices to major and only them out of the components. So I wonder whether it's is the answer like less able to adapt or perhaps other things that are different, um, at different speed.

Um, Yeah, I dunno. Yeah. So it's not like a direct answer. There are just differences in way of approaching those community company. Okay. So I'm almost going to come back and say that I don't think either government or the private sector, in most cases, there are a few exceptions do a good job of actually understanding their supply chains anyway.

Okay. I know. And you know, at the same time, uh, anybody in the industry, it's pretty much. China's one AI over the us, uh, uh, we've got UK government coming out with its national AI strategy. And I have to say, you know, we don't have much of an industry in that space in comparison, but what I, what I know I can see what this is going to lead.

I mean, we've got 43 police forces. I'm sure we're going to end up with 43 custom built AI solutions or doing exactly the same thing, but in a completely different way, all paid for through the nose to very expensive management consultants. We don't do it this way. Um, but, uh, That sort of waste. Um, you know, and again, that's the sort of waste you can see hits the press and all the rest of it as well.

But I still is nothing compared to what I see in the private sector. And because the difference is with the private sector, you have the magic carpet. So what we do is we lift up the magic carpet, we sweep it under and we just pretended didn't exist. And I passed. Really, what was it? 1.2 billion. I think it was private cloud, but, uh, I, I said, I explained to the company, I could build it all for 25 million and they were like, how would you do that?

Simple, pay me 25 million or sit on a beach for five years. Then you phoned me up and I can just say we failed. And that way you'll have saved all the rest of the money. Uh, but you know, they went away and they spent their money and this sort of stuff is common. All right. Anyway, too much. Uh, I'm terrible, too much CIM waiting for me.

Yeah, it's amazing to see resilience, stability, a sustainable in society is three tracks. This map camp. Thank you very much. Uh, very grateful for you making that comment. If you had a choice, start a fourth one. Oh, which theme would you have added? I think I'm in trouble for doing three because. Too many good speakers and too many interesting talks all at the same time.

I think it would be terrible, uh, to, to add, uh, any more, but resilience, sustainability society. If I was going to add a fourth one, Um, I really would want to pull out a whole sort of power exclusion, uh, or truism, uh, type, discussion into it as well. Um, so, um, uh, that sort of put the beliefs and the values.

So I probably would wanted to pull that out. I'm not very good at the top of my head, Chris, which, which would you have added? I don't have an appeal about that. The thrill more than enough. Um, what I could, what I have tried could do, or would like to do is to add the fault. One focused on purely use cases is like, how do you construct them?

Hold them up. And how do you use it in practice for, for your business. And also for this reason, there will be a next event in about a month focused just on the. Fantastic. I mean, that's a, you come up with great ideas. Uh, yes, actually that would be a fantastic book. Track actual use cases and yes, you you've got an event coming up in Germany, I believe.

Uh, but it's a virtual event. One is that it's in November. Isn't it? Yes, it it's in November. And the link is available on the main map com map com call UK. And that's all going to be used cases, never, ever, things like that. Fantastic. That's one of the beauties I learned about the mapping community because you know, these conferences and events appear all over the place.

Small groups often, sometimes the larger ones are appearing. It's just fantastic. I cannot stress enough. The benefits of. Um, so now we've got another question. How do you need to introduce climate change and low carbon imperative to business maps? Sometimes it seems that we need to go backwards because outsourcing and specialized society, me a, I mean today, a lot of competent.

Okay, so this is a really interesting one. One of the patterns that you learned with mapping is that as things evolve, they enable higher order systems to appear. Um, and of course those are higher order systems than evolve and enabling higher order systems to appear. And so on. And so what you get is something known as Jevons paradox.

Uh, so, uh, this comes from the cold question. So it was, uh, 80, uh, gosh, sweetie say 60, 70, something like that. I've got a book back there somewhere. Um, and so what happened is they made steam engines more efficient and everybody thought that would mean less, less coal was needed. Uh, actually what happened?

His car went up because he made steam engines more efficient. So you found more uses for steam. So the problem we've got is as we evolve things, we build higher older systems, which always consume more of the underlying components. And as we go up the chain, of course, we're moving from a disordered to an ever more ordered state.

And that, you know, basically entropy. Energy. So unfortunately the net result of competition, whether it's conflict, collaborational, cooperation, or cooperation or whatever it is, is forever going to be building higher order systems, which means we're going to forever need more energy. So our first issue is we've got to, um, Hey, we don't need, we don't understand.

Changed most of the time. So we then know where we're spending, what we're spending B w you know, we're going to have to accept the fact that, uh, you know, we will forever consume more energy. Yes. We can make some efficiency gains and everything else, which is great, but we've got to we'll end up consuming more.

Got to really think about the sources of energy. It's got all be renewable, et cetera. And so then we have the other issues, you know, because it's not just a camp and it's all the other resources we're going to have to, at some point start having the conversation about consumption and the way that we actually consume things, because this is one of the things I used to work in the environmental field.

About 30 years ago, I find. I mean, we really still don't have that conversation about Mo frankly, we cannot consume fair. Forget just about the carbon. We just cannot consume at the rate we're consuming. Uh, it's just not sustainable. Can this sort of stuff be mapped on a, on a map? Yes. Uh, I mean, um, often maps would, would diagram capital flow and well, we can use risk as well.

There's actually no reason why we can't put a map on it. Uh, uh, carbon usage and hopefully, uh, in the software world with things like surface platforms, you're going to see more over time, uh, you know, carbon. Uh, cost per function. I think Google made an announcement. I think it was yesterday or the day before about they can have it to see your comp and footprint in that cloud service.

I mean, this sort of stuff is, is X of news. Um, Chris, any, any, any pose of wisdom to add? Well, I would outsource this question to persons who do this routinely. I'm thinking about Paul Johnson or Chris Adams. So essentially that type of work. Requires the person to know both sustainability while they mapping.

And perhaps it's a bit of your business. So giving a shout in the slack channel community forum or anywhere else perhaps would be probably like the first good step to get started. I am Paul, Chris Soule, all these sorts of people. Fantastic. Always were speaking to. So, um, next one curious about mapping can be used with different anchor point than a user.

Okay. So. Oh, maps have this perspective. And that perspective is your perspective as the person writing the bat. And also from the point of view that you're actually looking at, you said they're not only imperfect. They are projections of the space. Now they are not the territory. So often you will have things like maybe the user, maybe the business, maybe government, oh, you might have different nations.

Um, um, when you draw. What you often do as well is you, the tendency is always to draw the components the way you treat them. You should always try and draw them in terms of the market. And then usually put a dotted red line backwards to where you treat them, because it's quite common for most legacy of most organizations is custom built stuff, which became a commodity a long, long time ago.

And so, so that's commonplace. Um, so yes, you, you, you can have any sort of grouping of users. When you think about that, every single component is in fact another map. So they're all anchors of their own maps as well. Um, so any, it doesn't have to be a user, you could actually use any activity, any practice, any data or any, any piece of knowledge, any ethical value that start with that as the anchor of your map?

Uh, Chris, any wisdom? Nope. Nope. Okay. I do. I managed to answer that one correctly. Okay. Do you want to pick the next one? Okay. So although we know that maps are for generic and discussion men and the people who, my approach with them in business say they look extremely complicated and don't want to use them.

How do we best position them as an exploration and should be perception of accessibility in no time, executive focus? Um, So I have a set of practices around this, and I'm not sure whether they are suitable for everyone, but I generally believe that you shouldn't be preaching what limb up to anyone. Um, because people essentially don't want to learn what they're mapping for the sake of what their mapping, unless you can prove it, generate some insights there.

They weren't able to, not this area. And even if they, if you prove it, they may be quite unhappy because you have chaperone there. So what I advocate doing is essentially simplifying the maps as much as possible and doing very short introductions. I mean, even skipping the introduction to worldly mapping because the evolution parents are almost self-explanatory region as this customer product and utility, showing them the value.

One component at a time with a commentary, they will understand it because it's their environment. And then showing them the thinking. If they get the thinking, they will probably like the two. And it's as simple as that. If not, then you have, then you have something to discuss. Um, you will probably get a couple of questions and maybe after a second, third, fifth time, it will find out a quick.

That's good. No, I, uh, well, uh, often the answer would depend upon how much I liked the person. Uh, if I don't like the person, I tell them to go hire McKinsey, build a mainframe and spend a load of money on new flash off it's. Um, because these are really simple things. Or if I really dislike them, I'll give them a little T by two.

And just in a, um, it does, uh, take a little bit of effort I'm afraid. And some people, you know, they want an instant decision. And I think this problem comes from something called Ashby's law, requisite borough. Uh, so just to explain it, um, when you manage an environment, uh, the controlling system managing the environment has to have as much complexity as the inputs and outputs of what you're actually controlling.

Now, life I'm afraid is complicated and complex. It's all of those things. So, so you've now got two choices in business life. Um, your two choices are. You can either embrace this and realize that you have to build the capability to, to communicate and understand this, uh, how as complicated and complex environments and share it with them.

And that requires having a common language or something along those lines. Or you can just pretend it. And then we do that all the time. Uh, we call those KPIs. So basically they're just an attempt to pretend. Life is simple. Give us a two by two and you know, because it's quick and easy. There's a phrase which is, as people say, keep, um, keep it simple, stupid kiss.

They say, keep it simple, stupid. That's the phrase. Um, Well life isn't like that. So what they're actually saying is keep it simple. I'm stupid. As in, I do not want to look at this environment. I do not want to just tell me which lever to pull. Uh, so I can, and that is where the consultants come flying in.

Cause that happens. Yeah, that's the way she paid for lots of money, uh, whether it's right or wrong, it's something completely different, which is why I do like so much, uh, Ben's learn, we'll be mapping where he goes along. And he says, if you do the course for 30 days, and if you don't get the money back from the course, a hundred times, that money he'll refund you.

I think that should be the new standard consultancy model. When I hire a big consultancy for a million or 2 million or 5 million to 10 million. If I don't get a hundred times that money back within a limited period of time and they should come back and refund me all of my money. I think that's, that should be the future model.

So the answer is I'm afraid. Um, yeah, it can be a bit tricky. Uh, it takes a little bit time. You know, people are often not used to this. People are often got a lot of inertia because they'd never looked at the environment for, so it can be a bit daunting. I think it's worthwhile. I think people should, uh, do this.

I mean, um, uh, if they are very resistant and all the rest of it, they want to, uh, there's not much you can do about it. I wouldn't waste time. Just send them off to a big management consultant and spend some money. So, uh, next one, Chris, when you map the capabilities on the map can be yours. Or someone else and then advice on how to manage selecting actors in a map.

Oh gosh. That's interesting question. The question of purpose, isn't it. It's what you are trying to achieve. And this determines who is the main actor, because you can map this essentially the same business from a variety of perspectives. And this time you're deciding Ancora will be different and. I mean, perhaps not a little bit different, but we'll be positioned in different places on the map.

So it's like the goal that our minds of, of who are the actors. I just, I totally grabbed, but I've just seen this other question here. I'm just going. Cause I've just noticed, uh, we started off with 11 questions. Uh, we're about 35 minutes through, we've got 24 to go. So, so this is like a, where this is going to be whole is getting deeper and deeper and deeper.

There's a fantastic question here. Uh, Christophe, uh, are you mapping every conversation that you have. Okay. When you can see my hands, I'm just mapping in my mind,

the number of compensates pretty much, you know what I read books. Um, so. When I read books, I actually mapped the stories. Um, I, you know, go through our list. I look at the stories, I start picking them, but I don't map science fiction books, terrible re I I'm I'm. Most of my books are, uh, are not fiction. Um, they are, uh, um, so, uh, most of the journals, I think, so.

But I read, I start mapping the map, most conversations, I start, I pretty maps. And then halfway through the conversation. Now I start directing it with the map itself. So it's extremely common for me to do that. And if I'm not doing that using my hands, I'm certainly doing that. Unfortunately in my mind these days, uh, Chris, is that, is that the same for you?

Yes. Yes. Yes. I arrived makes map. I mean, makes, make map on paper, but I tend to use. The evolution and a few buttons, like all the time can almost every possible top. Now we've been chatting away. So like, I I've noticed that we've, Steve has just turned up and also Jane, Steven Jane, by the way, have organized this, this event, I've got to say fantastic.

I know there's been a few problems with, uh, uh, connections and things out there saying, uh, you know, the, these things happen, unfortunately with events. Loved it so far. It's been brilliant. Uh, the, uh, and I just want to say a huge, thank you. Um, uh, you've done such a great job and I know you're also, um, embracing the charities as well.

At this point, I should shut up and just hand it over to you.

And you're both on mute. That's all right,

take a loose your number 222. I've got 26 questions. I haven't answered. Uh, I mean, I, I'm going to have to take a copy of all of these, take them away and see if I can answer them in tweets or something along those lines. So, uh, but anyway, now I am shut up cause I get. Far too much, and it is lovely to see both.

And I've got to say, thank you so much for doing this. No problem. Thanks so much. And thank you so much for all this opportunity. And thank you to all the fabulous map campus are doing such fabulous world for us as well as well, and to what I love responses. So we have the real pleasure of having some fantastic people joining us from Parkinson's UK orangutan, get outreach and cancer research.

So fingers crossed technology is working. We will be seeing them real soon. And, um, I'll be asking them just to a few minutes to just to give us a bit of awareness of the charities. And then fingers crossed. We have a very, very special guest joining us to announce how much we've raised for the charities as well.

So we're hoping that this is all going to go super smooth. So we're it from there. So I'm looking everywhere trying to see where they're going to be joining us soon. So I must enjoy I've enjoyed the camp so far. It's been.

You say, and the minutes before they're due to join us. So if you want to just answer one more question, Simon filtrate, uh, you know, mystery guest sounds like a bit of X-Factor about this one. At that point, I waited to say Amy mall. Oh, dear idea. I remember articles. And a restaurant, sorry, me go back a very, very long time.

So as somebody becomes more commoditized, you obviously find that it needs down. The battery chain is new higher level systems. So perfectly normal things as they commoditize. What happened is you'll notice I often have a dotted buy in on the value chain or sometimes I just remove it. Um, it's not really an access issue.

You know, uh, pointed direction, that chain is constantly expanding. And so as abuse cross the hit, you know, it's like the piece of paper grows up that way. Uh, we build ever higher order, more complex systems I've um, so, um, I wouldn't think of it as, uh, an X and Y access because, but then that value chain just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows.

Uh, is that a fair statement, Chris? Yep. Um, show, do we have time to pick any more? There is one question about the foundation, which I think would be very useful to answer because it's like, what are you doing with the worldly foundation? So I'm not doing anything with it. So Steve percuss is going to. Um, when it came to things like, for example, um, training, uh, we've got people like Ben, um, doing pragmatic, uh, uh, walking mapping and others as well.

Uh, when it came to certification before the whole Ducati and, uh, doing that sort of educational. Uh, conferences. We've got James, Steve doing things like Matt camp and Holger and yourself and others. Um, and so this idea came up for the foundation. And so we needed somebody to sort of lead the foundation.

I spent at the time, uh, quite a bit of time, a lot of time with Steve. And we talked about all the different ideas and the values and things that it would need. And then it was made a decision that, uh, Uh, we, we discussed amongst ourselves that Steve wanted to give this again, but in order to actually get it off the ground, it's actually going to take a bit of capital.

And so you asked the question, the community, if the community wants to fund it and Steve and we'll make it happen. But if the community does. Find it then fine, but ask the question next year or maybe the year after, or maybe the year after, at some point in the future that we are enough of the community that thinks it's necessary, they're involved, but you know, Steve is going to sort of lead that sort of charge.

I think the ideas behind it in terms of bedding values, in terms of, uh, um, uh, training and support while supporting the community, helping other people. Raise funding and so forth. I think we're all positive, good things. So we shall see how it goes. Really. Does that answer your question, Chris? Good. I mean, it wasn't my question.

Fair enough. Especially at that point, I will now get quiet and back over to Steve and change. Thanks so much Simon. And just to confirm that Steve Perkins, not Stevie Hutson. So,

so I'm, I'm delighted to introduce our lovely sort of representatives from our various charities. So, um, if you would love to say hello, that'd be great. So, um, if we could start off with. With, um, one of my dearest friends in the world, actually, Richard, I adore you loads and you're very famous in the Washington post as well.

So, um, so this is Richard Zimmerman. He's a absolute staff from a Wrangler tank outreach. So, um, do tell us about what the marvelous things that you've been up to. That would be really fantastic. Uh, hello everyone. Uh, great to be here and thanks for the interest, Steve. Um, we've known each other a long time through my wife who couldn't quite be with us.

She's hearing spirits. Um, but she's, uh, busy with work right now. Um, gosh, I I've been doing a ringer 10 outreach. I started it almost 15 years. Um, which you probably remember, Steve, it was just a dream from someone who's obsessed with orangutans and saving them in the wild. And, uh, I've grown it into a powerhouse of an organization supporting projects in Borneo and Sumatra, rescuing orangutans, rehabilitating them, releasing them, caring for them.

Um, and, and between all of our partnerships in our network, there's, there's hundreds and hundreds of orangutans under our watch. So we were just thrilled to be here and always thrilled to meet new people and, uh, really teach them about orangutans and, and how much we love them and how awesome they are and how much we want to save them.

So I'll leave it at that. Thanks Richard to restart. That's absolutely amazing. Sonya too. Welcome to our wonderful little session here and all the map campus, super keen to hear from all of you. So obviously you're from lovely cancer research UK. It will be absolutely fantastic to hear about the cool things that you've been up to as well.

That'd be amazing. Hello. So I'm Sonia from cancer research UK. Uh, so as we're all aware, the last 18 months have been quite different. Um, so myself personally, I've been working from home a lot. Um, but what we have done throughout the pandemic is really try and raise the awareness of how, uh, cancer and people going into the GPS and getting.

Diagnosis have really been affected throughout the pandemic. Um, so been working a lot with the government, uh, GP body, um, to try and encourage people to still go to their doctors. We are aware that a lot of people have missed out on routine screening, uh, over the pandemic and really trying to get people to, if they've missed them, please rebook them now.

That hopefully GPS and I'll take him face to face. Um, we've made some changes in the charity, uh, and we are working on lots of new research to try and bring the day where more counselors are cured, uh, and that hopefully three and four people survive cancer. Uh, so it's certainly been a very different year also.

Um, but we have certainly. Hit some amazing achievements in this last year and COVID did not stop us. That's so exciting to hear. So thanks. Just goes to prove about the great humanity that we have, and that's what, that's what we're trying to achieve as well. So, which is brilliant. So on that lovely note, there from that as well, Tom, so lucky to see you and obviously, you know, you're very personal to me as well because my mom suffers from Parkinson's and dementia is.

Um, so that's another reason why we've got puffs and UK, and Jane's very connected to cancer research, and obviously I'm connected to all of you really, so would be absolutely fantastic to hear what about pockets as you can, what you're trying to achieve as well. Thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. And I just, yeah, just a huge thank you to you guys for, for nominating us and, uh, and giving us this opportunity and, um, some great charities and causes that you've chosen.

Um, so I'm Tom I'm court parts manager at Parkinson's UK, um, and, uh, with pockets and she, the UK charity that supports people living with. Um, and many of you will know someone who's been affected by Parkinson's, but you may not know what Parkinson's actually is. It's a, it's a pretty brutal and, and, um, difficult condition to live with.

And, and kind of what on said as well, has been a difficult year for people living with Parkinson's, who, um, uh, you know, our groups haven't been meeting, um, there haven't been that face-to-face interaction. Um, and, um, but yeah, we've had to, you know, launching the. Uh, emergency appeals to kind of keep the funding coming through with the lack of events that have been happening.

So being able to come and talk to you guys as a, is a great opportunity to do that, but. Yeah, for us, our focus is on supporting people live in Parkinson's and then funding the research that's needed to kind of find a cure for Parkinson's and, um, yeah, 144,000 people live, um, in the UK with Parkinson's. Um, and if you, we say if you know, 66 people you'll know someone living with.

Um, but you may not know what the condition is. It's a, it's a condition that has about 40 symptoms, um, ranging from, you know, mental health conditions to the more well known the tremors, um, the freezing, um, of your kind of motor symptoms. So, um, yeah, it's a really difficult is traditionally seen as an older person's disease, but actually all condition I should say.

Um, but actually 10%. People living with Parkinson's or under the age of 50. So, um, and it's the fastest growing neurological condition in the world. So, um, yeah, the more help that we can get out there in terms of raising awareness, using these opportunities, it's really helps to actually give the true picture of what Parkinson's actually is so big.

Okay. Cool. Thanks. Thanks. All right, so we're at time. So just a quick question as we're waiting for a certain person for us to join. Um, so, um, what would you really like to see happen in the next sort of like years for yourself? You know, if you looked at your personal charities and wanted to have an achievement, just one small thing.

Cause I know that's what it's all about for us. Isn't it. So it's just, if we could just change one, 1% in our particular charity or life or career, what would that be for you? I don't mind.

Uh, I'll stop then. Um, so for me, it's, I would like to see the stigmas around, um, visiting the GP, uh, to potentially be crushed a little bit more. Um, um, we need to also appreciate, but cancer doesn't affect a particular age range. It affects everybody. No one is. Not going to be caught with cancer. Every age can be affected.

It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. Um, and we've noticed particularly in the pandemic, a lot of younger generation. Finding out they've got cancer and they've gone through social media and really used social media to highlight their treatments and their struggles through the pandemic. Um, and it, for me, I would like to really see more people going back to the doctors, getting their screen.

And so we can catch people earlier. Um, Because cancer has a higher survival rate and a better treatment plan if caught earlier. Um, and it's, it's just heartbreaking to see people in the latest stages of treatment, um, because it has that ripple effect. Once one person's affected by cancer. So many are, um, so fingers are crossed.

More. People will go back to the doctors, uh, and I'm really working towards reducing the stigmas. Sharon things like how to check for signs and symptoms with breast cancer, because it affects male and female. Uh, and it's a very big stigma around males. Think him, it won't affect them, but breast concept does.

So that for me would be an amazing thing to try and achieve and testing. What about you? Oh, gosh, uh, an end to deforestation, uh, for starters, um, what we'd like, um, what basically in Indonesia, all of these orangutans were currently at rehabilitation and care centers sitting in cages. We'd like to get them out of the cages as quickly as possible and into safe areas of a forest so that they can live free and, and God-willing breed because babies are the secret to the future.

And the ones that can't be released, we would really like to be able to build them sanctuary spaces that aren't cage, because animals in cages is. Absolutely what we're trying to stop. So that would, that's our goal animals out of cages and into forest breeding. Brilliant. That's fantastic. Well, thank you so much, Tom.

We'll come back to you a bit later. I do have the. Pleasure an absolute dream to have one of my best friends come and join us today. Thank you so much for joining us. This is the most amazing friend of my life as well. Can I introduce Alexandra Burke? Thank you very much for joining.

I'm delighted. How's it gone today. So far, the rest of the crew had a very interesting tech issues, but we're all here and it's all fabulous and techies are the worst because I'm the worst at anything that involves technology, to be honest. But Jane, did you sought out or was it still. Um, give you two guesses.

Okay. So guys, I just wanted to say, well, I'm here. Steve has asked me to come on and announce. I raised. And it's a very exciting, because when I, when I was actually told how much has been raised, I just think it's really generous of people to donate their money and stuff, because they know what it's going to and the outreach that it will bring to others and stuff.

So I'm going to say how much it is, but I'm going to let Steve tell me when I'm allowed to, when am I allowed to say.

I'm going to share news that people already know. So Matt campus and the world. So the lovely Alexandra is about to announce how much we've raised. I think that we all do it. RO to introduce to the money. That would be a rebel remix.

this is Alexandra is back garden.

So we will be dividing that all equally to the charities. Um, we own a bit with timeline because we have to let the green next session start everything else. But from my bottom of my heart, Alex, thank you so much. You're a diving.

When I'm not in the Stu Jen I'll make more time. I promise. Okay. That's so sweet of you. Thank you very much.

Lots of love. My lovely. So, um, to

see, okay. Little too excited.
