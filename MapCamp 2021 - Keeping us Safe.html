<h1>MapCamp 2021 - Keeping us Safe</h1>
<p>How you use sharing? CA am I going to be sharing was showing the slides. I am. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Let's get this thing going. Uh, so I am Katz Patel. I'm the chair for the society track. And you're currently on the society track right now. This is the keeping us safe session. And today I am joined by Rachel Murphy and Julie Pearce, and we are very excited, uh, and Rachel is going to be up first.</p>
<p>Uh, and she is the CEO at different and different is. A company that's focused on creating positive change by ensuring that public services truly meet the needs of the people that they're intended to serve. Imagine that, uh, and I lead they're specifically focused on healthcare and government and Rachel has history of, uh, amazing high profile positions in the tech world.</p>
<p>Uh, yes. So we're very pleased to have you here today, Rachel, and, uh, awesome to have you kickoff on this track. I'll go ahead and share. Thanks.</p>
<p>You see the sides? Oh yeah, I can. So thanks very much for the intro. Uh I'm uh, I'm Rachel Murphy, uh, CEO of different, uh, and as Kat said, I'm here today to talk about how we use Wardley mapping to keep us safe. So next slide please. We, uh, we got a phone call on Sunday night, so going back a, uh, sorry, first light.</p>
<p>Brilliant. We, uh, we got a phone call on a Sunday night, um, from the NHS, uh, and they asked us to stand up a multi-disciplinary team, but literally the, the following day, uh, and, um, the, the ask really was about, uh, designing and building a brand new home test ordering service, um, within an eight day period.</p>
<p>Um, and the, the ultimate outcome here. I was actually about getting key workers who didn't have COVID-19 back to the front line. Um, and you know, in case that challenge, that challenge, wasn't interesting enough already the team we're never gonna set foot in the same physical location, um, as we were all actually working remotely now, once that feels completely normal today, um, at that time that was alien to most people, uh, most teams that were working from a collaboration perspective, especially if they hadn't met before, uh, we're physically in, you know, in a room together.</p>
<p>So next slide please cap.</p>
<p>And then way of, of delivering the, uh, delivering the impossible. So if we, if we go back to March, 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis was escalating, um, and I think, you know, we, we naturally move on so quickly that it's quite easy to forget what that period of time was was like. But the reality was we were all being sent home from work.</p>
<p>You know, we have those daily briefings, um, from, you know, senior government, uh, members, the supermarkets were being cleared out of all essential supplies. I mean, of course, that that aspect has continued various other reasons, but the reality was more and more people were starting to show symptoms of COVID and were actually having to self isolate because we were desperately trying to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>And the, the reality of course, was there was a, I think a much higher level of kind of fear and concern from people. Everybody was on hyper alert. Um, And then his week started to understand how the virus showed up and people they were infected. Um, the reality was at that time, we didn't have the testing capabilities that we now have.</p>
<p>So test for COVID, we're only just beginning to be developed and, and therefore, anyone who showed any symptom at all of, um, you know, a slight cough cold, um, they had to be cautious and they had to isolate straight away. And the reality is that that actually included about 40% of key workers from frontline NHS roles.</p>
<p>And because we didn't have an easy way to confirm whether it was COVID-19. There were thousands of people who were isolating unnecessarily, what symptoms could well be just the common, cold or allergies, but without the ability to take that test and find out they had to isolate. Now this, this problem kind of can't really be overstated.</p>
<p>This was the, this was the worst possible time to have gaps from a workforce perspective within the NHS. So the NHS needed to be at full capacity and some, and if we move on to the next slide,</p>
<p>Brilliant. Thanks. Kay. So in way of the approach that we actually took to this, you know, how do you go about achieving something like this in the week and the reality for Rosie's. But normally, if we were tasked with designing a surface from scratch, we would be running a, a dedicated discovery phase. We would be doing loads of research and analysis to be really clear that we'd fully understand the problem.</p>
<p>And then we would move through, uh, the, the normal project, uh, phases. So we'd go through an alpha, we would test out some new ideas. We then do a beta before going live and even live. We would be slowly testing and then scanning the stuff. And the reality is we didn't have the luxury of time. Everything was super agile.</p>
<p>Um, and, and we had to move quickly and we had to take a much leaner approach than normal. So what we did is we, we assembled a small disciplinary team, literally overnight. So the call came to me at 10:00 PM on the Sunday night, uh, that night we assembled the team. They started the Monday morning. So there was a product manager, there was a service designer and there was a technical architect and we actually partnered with experts from other organizations to deliver that in twin service.</p>
<p>Um, so we were working with Amazon to fulfill the test kit orders. This was before the post office got involved in, um, You know, providing those specialists postboxes um, we worked with an organization called Randox to do the lab analysis of the tests, and it meant that really quickly, we had to get aligned.</p>
<p>We had to build a relationship and we had to get behind that joint outcome, um, that we, we had to deliver. So we had to work as one team really quickly. And the, you know, the only way that you can do do that and deliver a service like this in a week was to be truly agile and truly collaborative. Um, and, and we very quickly got into a rhythm of, um, of kind of lean iterative cycles.</p>
<p>So each hour we would be rapidly moving from collecting insights through research. Fruit to mapping out the service. And we use Wardley mapping as a joint tool between all entities to actually create that service map. Um, and we started sketching interfaces and building them immediately into code. So it was literally, you know, almost a thought do instant instantaneously to make sure we're anywhere near that timeline.</p>
<p>And then we would testing our ideas and we would make an improvement straight away. So based on the feedback that we were getting from users and stakeholders, and this really was the key to the success of this service. So I breaking down those silos by having a tool that we agreed, we were going to use their worldly mapping, um, meant that we could.</p>
<p>We could clear out any barriers between research design and build, and we could adopt that kind of one team approach, um, super quickly, uh, and then testing and learning and iterating happened literally overnight. Um, and it's really important tonight that once we did this at breakneck speed, the reality is we, we didn't have any other option.</p>
<p>We didn't cut corners on things that really mattered. So ensuring that the service was inclusive and accessible. So alongside the rapid builder, as a digital surface, we also established a contact center to deliver offline support. So we wanted to allow people to order test kits over the phone if they couldn't get online and do it, do it through the digital service.</p>
<p>So we just move on to the next slide, please. And if I talk a little bit about what we actually delivered during that period of time. So the outcome on day eight was that we launched a new service and we launched it with a cohort of frontline staff from London, ambulance service. Uh, and they went through the process of actually ordering tests, um, and confirming whether or not they needed to isolate or could return back to the ambulance service in London and off the back of that, we then did a diary study, um, and, uh, feedback via text and phone calls about the experience before, during, and after all, during ordering the kits and actually speaking to the content center daily, to gather feedback on any issues and fed those insights directly into that cycle of iterate and improve in the service.</p>
<p>And this survey scaled up massively in a short period of time. So within a month, we'd launched nationwide for key workers, um, and a couple of weeks later, Post a minister role commitment. Um, we actually had to scale for citizens to order test kits as well. So again, you know, the, the, the original outcome and the original ask, um, got larger literally by, by the minute.</p>
<p>Um, and within three months we had distributed over a million test kits. So it's a, you know, a massive achievement for the team that were involved. Um, and, and something that I'm particularly proud that, that different, um, played a part in. And the, you know, the, the team, the team all got a letter, um, from Boris Johnson, uh, in way of thanking them personally for their contribution, um, in, you know, in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>And if we just move over to the, to the final slide, please, camp, of course, the reality is. The, um, you know, the service didn't stand still. So the system has subsequently evolved into everybody getting tested via packs that have been sent out fire the packs of lateral flow tests that we, you know, we, we all, well, we all order in on a regular basis to, to keep ourselves safe.</p>
<p>Now, um, the same service has been, um, developed upon to create the PCR and location, but also the vaccinations and ultimately, um, you know, the COVID passport using, um, the NHS app. So. Um, in, in way of, in way of an outcome, we absolutely take that box. But I think, um, there were a couple of components that enabled us to really move at pace.</p>
<p>And for, for me, you know, what the mapping played such a fundamental part in that, because it was a tool that unified that team and those partners, uh, and it was a language that everybody spoke, which meant that we could collectively move at pace. There were many other tools that we use along the way. Um, but in, in way of a, you know, a central tool that helps design and build an iterate and the service, it was the, uh, it was the, uh, the worldly map pain.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, I'm handing back over to what to you, I believe camp.</p>
<p>Cool. Thank you so much for that. Uh, rare glimpse, I guess, behind the scenes of something that we all saw play out in the news and everything like that. So, very interesting. Thank you very much. Um, yes. So we do have some questions in the chat and the first one is, uh, what was the biggest challenge or roadblock in this endeavor?</p>
<p>I don't know how you're going to pick the biggest, because I think there were many, um, I think that's a great question. Um, I would say at that time, the biggest challenge and the biggest roadblock was the fact that whilst we're a digital business and we probably worked part time remotely, we hadn't all fully worked remote for an extended period and we would then work.</p>
<p>With partners who we knew off, but we hadn't worked together before. So I think, um, you know, the, the NHS at that time, and now actually, uh, Ron's I think a lot on Goodwill, um, but the, the level of Goodwill and the level of desire to respond to the challenge at that time was like something I've never seen in, in my, in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Um, and, um, I think the, the ability for people to pull together, um, get, get around the problem and really respond to that remotely, um, was the fit for me that I think was the, probably the biggest challenge. Um, And the biggest challenge that we over, we overcame, uh, and the fact that some of the team at Amazon we're familiar with Wardley mapping as well, uh, made the, made the challenge a bit easier.</p>
<p>So what we weren't trying to do was train people on, you know, on, on the use of that as a multiple, we, we happened, you know, you can call that good luck or divine intervention. Uh, but we happen to have a team who are familiar with, um, and wanted to use that actively as a tool to, um, kick the tires on the service build.</p>
<p>And, and the reality of course, is can, you know, building a digital services only, ever a small part. I think the challenge, especially with something like this, you know, the logistics work where we're probably a bigger part of the service built, um, because. Uh, job to a certain extent was made easier by the good work that's happened with government digital services.</p>
<p>You know, we plugged into notify. So we were reusing a lot of, um, you know, of tools that had been, been built up.</p>
<p>Yeah. You touched on a couple things there that I wanted to ask. I don't know that they are questions in the chat, but I'm, this is my show. So I'm going to ask, um, I was just struck by the irony, right? That you are creating something to get people physically back to work, and you're having to do it. You're having to create this thing to get people physically back to work in an entirely remote way.</p>
<p>So that good question, that, so we, we could have physically gone in and been based in Wellington house so we could have done that. But, but my decision as a business owner, two weeks before the national lockdown was the, I pulled all of my people off client side and, and this didn't make me particularly popular with all of our customers.</p>
<p>Um, we did it in consultation with. But for somebody who spent many years working in healthcare. Um, and I don't know whether it's driven by the fact that I'm sort of chronic mathematic, but I was super cautious when this landed about the impact. And I, I guess I, I, I really felt that it was attitudes of care to staff to have them work remotely.</p>
<p>So the NHS would have provisions based for us and Wellington house. Um, and it's not that I'm averse to traveling to elephant and castle. Um, it was much more around the fact that I was nervous about having people, um, in a physical environment when we were dealing with something that was so unknown. Um, and, uh, it, yeah, but, but you're absolutely right.</p>
<p>There was some irony around the fact we were serving up a solution to get people back to a work place, but we were all working remotely. Yeah. Very interesting. Yeah. And then the other thing that really struck me was the thing that we've all been talking about. Like Simon was talking about it this morning.</p>
<p>We've all been talking about this, but just the logistics of, of things like this that are really a blend, right. There's a fiscal element and there is a digital element and, um, those supply chains have been wild in the past year. Distribution has been wild in the past year, year and a half and for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Right. Not only COVID. Um, so I, I guess I'm just really curious about that interaction, how you had to think through. So I think, um, I think that the first part of your question that can, um, the surface, you know, that kind of, uh, service design role is, is, is such a specialist one for that reason. So I think there's an assumption.</p>
<p>A lot of the time the service design role is building pretty digital services. And, and that really does it if their surface, because the reality is, you know, to truly build a service, you must be considering the supply chain, the logistics, you know, in the end to end the stuff that touches the digital, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the stuff that sits outside, um, And that, um, that, that was absolutely part of the, part of the challenge here.</p>
<p>Um, and, and I think, again, I think the Goodwill probably drove some of that stuff through because, um, you know, where were contracts in place? Was everybody on drug purchase order? We know that they weren't. I know that we weren't. Um, so, you know, there was an awful lot of ours taking a bit of a punk phone calls late on a Sunday night and doing everything we could to, to, to make it happen.</p>
<p>Um, is it the right way to do it? Probably not. Um, but the reality is, and I sincerely hope this is the only pandemic I'll say in my lifetime. Um, so I think every. You know, for people that work in health care and have a real love affair with it. Um, the pandemic to a certain extent is the ultimate calling.</p>
<p>Um, so, uh, that's, I guess probably drove some, some of, uh, some of that behavior, but I do think there's a, I still think there's a lot, we need to learn around supply chain, um, when we're either working in government or healthcare, um, and understanding the logistics of that and the impact, um, the external factors can have, uh, I mean, you know, we've, we've seen it again recently with, uh, with, with petrol and other bits.</p>
<p>I mean, the impact of something that, you know, looked to be trivial, um, is, is, is absolutely huge. And, you know, I have a personal view that people probably got so excited about the petrol shortage, because they're so frustrated having had 18 months of being kept in a. Enclosed environment anyway, so, um, yeah, I think there's, um, I think if I had to retrain or maybe a service design, which will terrify my design team, hearing that, hearing that concept and actually can't, but, uh, what a fascinating, yeah, I totally agree.</p>
<p>And that is actually my third question. I was going to ask you, if you could explain to the audience, because I've, I've noticed, uh, not everyone understands what the role is of a service designer and then, but it just keeps coming up. Like you talk about this, right. J bloom has talked about the intersection of service design and uh, Wardley maps.</p>
<p>So I think it's a thing if you could talk about it for a second. Okay. So I think the service designer for me is probably one of the, um, one of the most interesting roles in, in, in, in our business. Um, and it's a role that really takes, um, Take some of the learnings from the use of researchers, um, and, and works with an organization or in government or NHS speak, you know, departments to, to understand, um, and to blueprint out what that service can look like mindful of.</p>
<p>Um, and it used the research, but also of any business research, um, from a constraint perspective and, and starts to run an end to end service around that. Uh, and, um, I think it's, um, I think it's an incredibly powerful role as we move, uh, from. Um, as, as we move from old school kind of project management and the waterfall ways of working in government and healthcare, and we moved to a much more service-orientated landscape.</p>
<p>So, um, yeah, it's a fascinating realm. Um, and there's, there's lots more, lots more there to do. I think in way of developing that as a, as a profession, I actually keep. But right next to my fight, you have someone at the door that can't, I wondered what was happening. I was just right here by my desk, the service innovation handbook.</p>
<p>And it, I think this, uh, like the explanation of service blueprints in here was so accessible for me not coming from a design background or anything like that. So, uh, highly recommend there's. Yeah, I think the other bit is the good services book. So the good services bookies is well worth the rate in way of understanding the impact that those services can make.</p>
<p>Um, so I, again, uh, you know, a fantastic, um, a fantastic point of reference for Fritz and me and, uh, as a business, something we actually, uh, we bought a coffee for, from Viet worked different. Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean, it's just a fantastic learning tool. Awesome. There's one more question, uh, in the QA here. Uh, so talking about scale, you had to scale up a couple of times through your story.</p>
<p>What were the biggest challenges in those big scale-up? Okay. I'll be honest with that. The biggest challenges with staying up to a minister, real commitments, um, that were unexpected, but for anyone, do you spend any time in government or health care that becomes a standard to a certain extent. And under these circumstances, you can understand that more.</p>
<p>So the original landscape was about key workers and, you know, in short order and I mean, very short order. Um, so if you imagine we got that service out after right days within two weeks of it going live, there was a request to citizens to start to use it. So it had been designed, um, and, and the capacity issue there was, was probably less logistics, more supply chain from a lab perspective because, um, The lab capacity.</p>
<p>A lot of it was being used in different ways. So, um, it was, you know, almost a ring around to, to, to Saltzer to think about how we could scale that up further. So the, the scaling wasn't restricted from a digital perspective, that side of it was very easy. Um, and, and, you know, that was easy because of the good work that had been done before, but it was more about the, um, you know, the, the access to lamps, uh, and the, the, yeah, the, the ask went from a potential workforce, you know, NHS workforce at 1.5, 2 million.</p>
<p>And if you imagine a percentage of that being frontline and 40% of that, uh, potentially isolate into being, you know, 70 million people. Uh, and so it was a, it was a hell of a, it was a hell of an ask. Um, and, uh, Yeah, the, the, the, the planning that needs to happen there, but again, it, it goes back to your earlier point.</p>
<p>It was around the, it was the logistics and the supply chain there that were the bit that we needed to scale up, rather than anything on the digital front end. I will just point out that this isn't a UK only problem, right. In case anyone thought that it was, uh, I think that 20, 23 budget priorities just came out from the Biden administration.</p>
<p>And I think the TLDR is holy smokes. Supply chain. What the heck do we got going on here? So, uh, certainly front and center for everyone. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I think these things only come into the thought when you have a problem. So if, very easy to just assume everything works like potluck, but at the point that, you know, a part of the system is pinched for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Um, and you know, it's like a stress ball. You squeeze it. Something's coming out the side. Yeah. Julie, do you have any questions for Rachel before we move into your session? Um, no, no questions, but there were, there were a number of points that, um, Rachel was, was making that were also sort of resonating. Um, and maybe from my talk, which comes, uh, which is about completely different domain than might look to have nothing at all to do with what Rachel was talking about.</p>
<p>But there were a few points. Maybe draw them, draw them out where there were similarities. Cool. Okay. Do you, are you ready to move into my, I think I'm ready. So I shall try and share my screen. So here goes, all right. Uh, I should say while Julie is figuring out the screen-sharing always fun with zoom. Uh, she is the director of openness data and digital at, uh, sorry.</p>
<p>I'm going to mix up the food standards agency. Right? I got it. Right. I always go to say the American one and I am so pleased to have her here with us, but it's certainly relevant for keeping us safe. Right. So Julia, I'll hand it off to you so much. So first, just to check, you can see my screen. Yeah. So, um, yes.</p>
<p>Um, as, as the title of this talk might imply, um, this is an update. Um, so, uh, I'm duty Pierce, uh, director, um, at the FSA with a wide range of responsibilities, including all things, digital tech, and also all of our scientific research. So.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, the food standards agency, um, we are here to ensure the food you all eat is safe, uh, and what it says it is. Um, and we do that working with local authorities, our sister organization in Scotland, industry, third sector, other government departments, and also international half, our food is imported.</p>
<p>So those international regulators, such as the U S FDA are really important to us as well. So there's a wide community of people trying to ensure the food you eat is safe. So my pain, this has been a long journey. Um, uh, it's been a great journey, but, um, we've been at it for a while now, maybe about sort of five years or so.</p>
<p>Um, and here here's a little picture. One of my favorites, um, from Matt camp back in 2018. And, um, some of you here today may have heard me speak previously about $5 maps on our experiences. So I'm here today to talk about our latest mapping adventures. So just going back to the past, where, where did we start?</p>
<p>And that's what this map is. A map of we've started mapping our as is, and then to be it. So we started with the technology, the FSA needed to operate as an organization, um, that was relatively familiar sort of stuff. Um, whilst we were looking at moving to cloud, it's still relatively tangible, the sort of stuff we were, we were talking about whether we were talking about hosting or we were talking about API APIs, or we were talking about sort of various digital applications.</p>
<p>We then, and we implemented, um, the maps. We implemented what we saw. So this wasn't a theoretical exercise, but we, um, decided to sort of go somewhere else. So the next place we went to was looking at something slightly less tangible. Um, and that was our, our data and the data data services. Um, um, that was a little bit different and slightly harder for us to map.</p>
<p>But, um, we, we did map those, those data services. Um, but then where to go next, we wanted to go outside the FSA and we wanted to map that, that wider world, the context in which we operate, that's where the people are. That's where the businesses are, but, um, manufacturing and delivering all of this food. And that's where we need to be operating to make a difference.</p>
<p>So some examples of our most recent adventures in mapping, um, the food hygiene rating scheme. I'm hoping everybody recognizes this little green sticker. Um, um, the FHR sticker is the jewel in the crown for the FSA. It sticks on, uh, food outlets, um, doors or windows. Um, and it's there to help consumers decide where to go eat, to choose the hygienic places, safe places to eat.</p>
<p>It's beautiful in its simplicity. It's a green sticker sticking on every door. It's very recognizable. Um, but because it's so great, somebody suggested that we change it. We change what it means. We change its scope and we try and do more with it. So we could add other things in. Maybe we add something around whether the business was good at food allergy management, we could also address digital businesses.</p>
<p>We could mandate display in England at the moment. That's only mandated in Wales and Northern Ireland. So there were lots of ideas as to how we could change the sticker. So this was an existing thing. It wasn't, it wasn't a new thing. Um, as, as Rachel's being been described, this was an existing thing you've been round for years and we all thought we understood it really well, how it worked, how it was used, but before we went to change it, we said, That's actually mapping it.</p>
<p>So, um, here's a map, it's an aggregated map. It's one of these, um, illegible maps. I, I've never found a really good way of, of sort of showing maps, such that anyone else, other than the mapper can really read and, and understand it. But, but that doesn't matter. So we were also working, uh, virtually, um, we were using mirror boards, um, for the first time.</p>
<p>And on this map, you can even so see some of the complexity of understanding the different actors in this space, even for something so simple. There was the FSA, there were businesses, there was the consumer, there were the local authorities and somewhere in the middle in one of those little red boxes, um, that's the little green street.</p>
<p>But as we mapped, we could pretty quickly see that that little green sticker was sort of exploding in front of our arms. It never quite dawned on us, the number of different actors, the number of different actions, um, and relationships that just enabled one sticker to appear on one restaurant store. So even whilst this is looking a bit of a mess, this in itself is, um, uh, tidy it up version of the map.</p>
<p>And, um, here we have the final version if such a thing exists in, in mapping and some of the points, um, I might draw out here is that up at the top, uh, we can see the consumers that using the sticker that using the sticker to try to decide where they eat and that's what it was designed, um, for that's what we thought was going on here.</p>
<p>Um, But we also realize that there were many other users of the information in the sticker. Um, so, um, up on the right-hand side, we've got other types of users, maybe businesses, themselves wanting to get a high rating because it generated confidence in their offer. They were using it as sort of like an internal assurance measure insurance companies, insuring that those businesses using the rating as an independent measure of confidence in the management of the business, that would impact the premiums.</p>
<p>They offered people outside of the food sector, using the open data of as a register of places that weren't private home. So where food is sold, um, it could be retail or it could be your office canteen, or it could be a hospital. They were pulling in that data just to, as, um, a good dataset. So we called those freeloaders, um, because they were consuming all of this information and the sticker wasn't designed for them.</p>
<p>Um, also within this map, we were starting to see the feedback loops and I think that's one of the things that Matt brought door out. Um, uh, maybe those are some of the things that should be designed in, or sometimes not designed in all those, those feedback back loops in the system. And we could start to see those.</p>
<p>So we were saying, um, a business getting a poor rating, um, actually driving pressure on local authorities to reinspect that business. So we were driving load, um, on, on local authorities between hadn't, hadn't quite appreciated. But also we realize those freeloaders, they will putting pressure on the system to improve.</p>
<p>So rather than being free, no, just they were becoming more and more important as to the influence and value they were offering to the whole of the system. Um, many of the people who are exercising the power on the system, weren't actually the consumers. They were everybody else operating around the whole of the system.</p>
<p>So our understanding of how the whole system worked is, is starting to, to share. The next thing we tried to do was to move the map. So in the boxes, um, pink boxes numbered one to four. These are opportunities where we could start to see places to intervene. So we could see opportunities to tighten up the flow of information throughout the whole system, make it better, make it faster, make it nearer, real time opportunities to get consumers and others to drive comments and feedback into the system.</p>
<p>And again, so improving the quality of the information that was available to increase in coordinate education, interventions, and change the inspection process. Maybe prioritizing risky businesses, um, over less risky, and also going remote or virtual for those inspections. So at the end of all of this, I didn't take very long.</p>
<p>Don't take took a few weeks to actually do, do the mapping. Um, The main products for us with the co-created and shared maps. And I emphasize co-created and shared. We had many different people in the room who were, um, in their day jobs, working on different parts of how the whole of this system worked.</p>
<p>But typically as many teams do, they worked in their own silos. So local authorities did that, but the FSA team did their bit. My digital and data teams did their bit. And then there were all these other people outside that we didn't even know about. But what we had here was, um, an ability to see everything that was going on and an appreciation that if we change something over here, we impacted somebody else's bed over there.</p>
<p>So in this sort of not dissimilar vein, continuing to map, um, there is parts of our external world food allergens. This is, um, a really important, um, high profile topic at the moment. And we've had, um, Natasha's law that's just been introduced. So this is an example where yes, Al food allergens have been around for a long, long time, but it was a relatively Greenfield site.</p>
<p>So he w we decided to map, um, and it was much more a blank piece of paper, much more around trying to understand, um, who the main actors were, um, where we might make the biggest intervention. So again, looking, remember, this is looking at that, that wider world, again, seeing some of the familiar players like businesses and local authorities, and also the consumers, um, So allergens affected some people directly, um, and also affect many others indirectly, whether they be, um, the parents or the carers or the businesses that are trying to, um, help those, um, allergy suffers.</p>
<p>Um, so again, it's already got quite a large, um, community of, of interest. Um, and what we're starting to see in, in here, and the gain is sort of picking up a little bit on that, that supply chain point. We're seeing tangible things going on in here. We're seeing, um, things like guidance or inspections or those sorts of hard things.</p>
<p>You've got kitchens, we've got websites, we've got information. But also, um, what we're maybe getting more and more confident and Odetta is, um, thinking about the intangibles. So up at the top, we've got, um, reducing stigma. So that's the same map can have on it. Something like reduce stigma or attic change attitudes, or, um, take away fear, whatever that means for the particular situation, as well as how typical of hard stuff like a platform or a train training course.</p>
<p>So I think that's one of our sort of takeaways for the map is the different types of things you can kind of. And maybe some of those, um, sort of non-tangible things they have proven to be a little bit harder for people to get their heads around. Um, they, people are generally happier mapping, a nice hard thing.</p>
<p>Um, unpacking it, understanding what's scope goes on, maybe start with the tangible, but then yeah. Um, don't, don't be afraid to move, move into the intangible and the, um, maps very much can help in that area. Moving on. Um, just another example, another, um, real need, but a diff a different area. So we're seeing the growth in, uh, digital platforms in, um, selling food, um, B to C, B to B to B.</p>
<p>Um, whether we see, um, the food aggregators, like some just state being one type of platform, right. The way through to, um, somebody like Amazon or eBay, Facebook. So there's a huge range of different types of digital platform. Um, and the problem that we have with that is that they're digital and they're hard to see.</p>
<p>Um, we're very much, um, organized to, um, regulate the physical world. We see food and shops and places in places in the highest. So these digital virtual platforms, um, but for us started off by being completely invisible. So that's been a challenge for us to try, try to see what's going on. Um, and once we started to see what was going on and we started to map it, um, the next question of course is, oh, so what should we do about it?</p>
<p>Um, where do we intervene? Um, what can we do to, to make those changes? And also. Great believers in reuse don't believe in creating anything from scratch, unless we absolutely have to. Um, we thought that safety tech being developed for other types of application, maybe covered by the online harms belt. Um, there's, uh, there's a growing, um, capability and, um, digital tools being developed over there.</p>
<p>Maybe we could, um, just pivot and apply that sort of technology into the food space, just to try and really see what was, what was going on, um, in the digital world. So again, a different sort of map involving different sorts of people in, in the conversation. Um, but pull together very quickly just in a matter matter of hours, but proven to be really valuable as we get our head around, um, a completely new sub-sector of the food system.</p>
<p>How a weld is no less confused than it was about four years ago. It's still complex and scary. Um, we we've mapped a lot of it. Um, but also realize there's a lot more that we, um, haven't seen or equally a lot more than some there's emerging because it's changing it very much in front of our eyes. Um, and the pandemic, um, that Rachel touched on that has had a huge impact on us in the last couple of years, um, major knocks into the end of the food system and how we all had to respond to that.</p>
<p>So, um, the world is still a very difficult, complicated space. That's not a reason to, um, not go look and not try to understand it. So we will continue just to keep mapping, just to keep trying to understand what is going on, um, what we might do to make things just a little bit safer and a little bit better for all of our consumers.</p>
<p>So where might we go next? So one idea I've got here is, um, the food label, um, the food label, I've blown it up here cause normally then, and this sort of a couple of centimeters big, um, so this little tiny thing that sits on sits on the package, um, that, um, I think the regulators think everybody reads the situ asleep.</p>
<p>Um, can we map that, that label? So. All the actual users of it, who is consuming the, um, data that is, that is on that, that label. Um, do we understand how, what the people consume the data, all that other ways, um, of, of consuming it rather than having it on a paper, paper label? What else could we do? Is it properly targeted at the people who are really interested in, um, all of that, that information?</p>
<p>Can we add to, um, what goes, goes on the label? So we have the, um, traffic light system and in addition to ingredients, so, um, let's add something for, um, um, carbon footprint, net, zero performance, et cetera, et cetera. So we're packing all of that, um, potentially onto the food label, but also. Looking in the other direction, all of that data to how did that data get there?</p>
<p>Is it good quality data is the path of the flow of the data through the system effective and efficient. Um, and we've just been talking about supply chains and, um, for, for us, yes, the food supply chain working through the pandemic, if you ever needed to have that supply, changing, being played out in front of you on a daily basis, that's, that's what we've lived through, um, where it's working, where it's not working, where it gets stuck.</p>
<p>But I keep saying to people, there are, um, I can look at that supply chain. I look at the supply chain of food and we need to understand that, but I'm looking at it as a supply chain of data. There is data flowing through the whole of that system. Um, so maybe we need to get better. Uh, understanding the flow of data as well as the flow of the physical product, the food.</p>
<p>So we're starting to get, um, an increased interest in, in understanding the food system as a system. And, um, we've been pushing for that over, over, um, a number of years. And I would say that for me has been a positive, um, byproduct coming out of the pandemic, just as that realization on the part of everybody, um, that it is a whole of a system and something tiny like carbon dioxide, certainly people appreciate what a huge impact something so small can, can have, um, So mapping gives us an opportunity to understand the whole of the system and to understand some of those, those weak points or some of those key critical points, um, where if you don't get it right, the system can really come under pressure and, and suffer.</p>
<p>Um, so I'm, I'm optimistic, um, that we are starting to get a much greater appreciation of the system appreciation of the importance of data, um, within the system, how it works, how it could work in the future, how we might, might change it, um, on the flu food label is just, um, one idea. But, um, I would really welcome if anyone in the audience has got any, any other ideas, um, really welcomed anyone else's thoughts.</p>
<p>Get it out there and, um, carry on these conversations. Um, and also anyone who wants to volunteer to be a mapper, um, because you are all actors in my system, um, on a daily basis. So you're very welcome to join us and try to map the food system. And finally, some things don't change. We are still here trying to keep you all safe on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So thank you very much.</p>
<p>Yay. That was excellent. Thank you so much. And you're so right. There were definitely themes across those two talks, even though they're completely different. Yeah. So thank you very much. There were definitely questions in. And the chat. So let's go to those. Uh, yes. The first one is how did you discover the components of your math in?</p>
<p>Um, it seems like they're especially curious about freeloaders and there was another question in the chat about like discovering the actors. So if you could talk about that, that'd be awesome. Yeah. We. We discovered them by, um, getting the right people in the room who actually understood what was, what was going, going on.</p>
<p>Um, they might not realize they were experts. And, um, often they sort of carried this information in their heads. They didn't, they didn't think they were. Teas or any particular insights and it wasn't written down. Um, but you get those people, people in the room and you start off with the sort of the obvious, um, simple stuff.</p>
<p>Um, and they in doing so they sort of understand it. And then you, you ask sort of open questions as to, um, is there, is anyone else using this data? Or I can see somebody is taking a download through our API on a regular basis. Why are they doing that? They wouldn't do that unless they were going to use something with it, do something with it.</p>
<p>So once you then started the process of thinking, there may be others, um, all those, those consumers, those users and beneficiaries, um, may be related to, to others. And once you opened up, I think having the conversation and opening up to the different types, um, And also understanding. And again, I think Rachel touched on this, it's the need too often.</p>
<p>Um, people like Rachel and I, we might start with the digital service and we start with a thing that's that big. Um, but again, coming back to the service design, it's very quick that we should be saying, hang on a minute. Are we really understanding the end when we really understanding some of those other beneficiaries, um, that sort of set out to that beyond just the simple consumer of the service.</p>
<p>And, um, so I think on putting that challenge on the table, you don't necessarily start there, but I think you need to take the conversation there to really be sure that you've got the whole thing mapped as well as you can. Yeah. Um, B idea that people are experts, even when they don't realize that they have expertise, that if, if anyone was at the map camp a couple of years ago, we talked about that in the fireside chat and that's kind of how.</p>
<p>Epistemic justice league was born. Right? Because we recognize that there are lots of people that are fish swimming in water, right? Like they're just doing the things that they do. And they're not even fully conscious that the expertise that they have. And one of the great things about Wardley mapping is that we can help get that expertise out and we can, uh, use the shared language to kind of recognize those things.</p>
<p>So, excellent point, Rachel, you have. Well, I thought I'd use a digital tool, throw your attention. Um, so the, the, the bit just echoing what Judy said there, but, but I, I think there is so much power in subject matter experts. Um, so I was, I was teaching a group yesterday. We'll be mapping. They'd never seen it before.</p>
<p>Um, and they, they, their overwriting view was, you know, we don't know how to map. And I said, well, we will in 30 minutes. So sit tight because what we're really after is your subject matter expertise. Um, and it's every time, you know, I, I teach it the kind of, well, firstly, it's, it's a privilege because it's such a powerful tool, but also the ability for people to then translate.</p>
<p>And have that debate and that's the power, you know, to, to Julie's point about everybody being the expert, the PA that the knowledge is all there. We're using it as a, as a tool to extract that in the language that is unified. And that for me is the real power of mapping. Yeah. I am totally agree.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Uh, okay. Yes. The next question, and I, I think I'm trying to go across the chat, the Q and a and Twitter right now to try to bring you these questions. Uh, so I think this kind of touches on a theme, but this question is, uh, in the case of remote inspections for these restaurants, was there any instances of fraud or did you have to explore that at all?</p>
<p>That is a new area where we started to, um, explore the opportunity for remote inspection. We haven't, um, and the local authorities themselves haven't done the thing. Um, well, so we're expecting that, um, whether it's, whether it's fraud or misrepresentation or, uh, maybe just being a bit silent on all of the information.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, we, we expect there to be a degree of that, um, until we will need to design some design, something in, I think the first thing for me is maybe the hardest thing, which was to, to sort of like let go of the physical inspection, um, and assuming whatever the problem was, the answer was going to be a physical inspection.</p>
<p>Um, and in, in many times, um, you can either resolve. The inspection, or it can be supplemented by other sources of data. So there are many different models. Um, and, and again, the need has come through through the, the pandemic people just couldn't physically go visit. Um, it was too, too risky, um, from a, from a COVID point of view and so sort of needs must.</p>
<p>Um, but again, that's something that we've now will inherit both, um, for us as the, as the regulator, but also, um, industry themselves. Yeah. Okay. So internationally from a trade point of view, um, sort of certainly China was starting to do remote inspections, virtual inspections from China to, to the other side of the world.</p>
<p>Um, so, so yes, we're starting to see more and more. Yeah, I think. Uh, we're picking up on a theme here. Again, you said something during your talk about everything that goes in to having that one little green sticker appear on the door of the establishment. And I was thinking, gosh, everything that goes into, you know, whatever, my cheeseburger that I'll eat later today.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, of course, a lot of things have to go into that green sticker because there is hugely complex supply chains that go into the food that we eat every day. So just makes sense. We now have Mr. Simon Wardley I don't know if anyone knows him chiming in, in the Q and a, so I suppose we'll entertain this question maybe.</p>
<p>Uh, but the question is Brexit and COVID seem to have exposed how poorly we seem to understand the basics of our supply chains or how the knowledge is trapped in individuals. Uh, I'm delighted to hear examples of mapping being used 10 years on from the better, for less paper. How widespread is this in government?</p>
<p>Any lessons or suggestions there? Um, yes. I agree with Simon. Um, the, the lack of understanding as being both at the same time, where there is understanding and detail, how well it's managed, it's also being exposed. And so we didn't know how well some bits were well working, which was a surprise, just sort of happens.</p>
<p>Um, I do think, um, that the next thing for me is to move forward to better understand the supply chains. I think our first challenge is actually going to be trying to work out where to. Where to go first, because it is absolutely huge. Um, and food doesn't exist in isolation. It requires a transportation.</p>
<p>And then if you suddenly find out that CO2 is used in, um, animal slaughter and it's used in your beer and it's also used in fertilizer and you sort of just start to sort of map out and it becomes really, really, really daunting. Um, and, um, then when we start to sort of map what's going on internationally with our imported food, um, we need to get ourselves into a place to not be completely sort of over faced by all of that together.</p>
<p>It's just too, too hard. Um, So, so what I'm trying to do is to try to, um, sort of identify where we might go next, the sticker, the label, um, is, is one sort of idea. There may be other, um, sort of sub sectors, you know, you might choose a commodity like dairy or some, something like that as you're just sort of slicing it.</p>
<p>Um, and, and in doing so I think the, the maps will be useful. We will understand what is going on and we'll, we will learn and much of what we learn then becomes, um, reusable, ELLs, and square. And one of the super important byproducts is, is that, um, is that capability, it's the shared language? Um, it's just knowing what we're talking about when we talk about, well, we'll move that over there.</p>
<p>You know, down to the right-hand side or we'll, we'll do this, or where's the anchor. So I think just having the language is also super valuable in all of this anyway. So just another reason to start someone. Rachel you immediately on muted when I asked her the question. So I assume you have a strong response.</p>
<p>I thought there was no point being subtle with me digitally raising my hand this time. So I, I agree with Simon, um, that, um, so there's definitely work to be done on the supply chains 200%, but I think that there is still work in the adoption of hoard them MFI across government. Um, and I, um, I was taught to Matt maybe 10 years ago when I was CIO at department of education.</p>
<p>Uh, and it is something that I have, uh, seen across government. Um, but, but it hasn't been adopted wholesale. So, um, as a business we've won business off the back of the ability we can map because we have clients specifically asking for it. Um, and I know Jonathan has asked a follow on question. Um, Around mapping and saying it's more consultancies that are driving that.</p>
<p>Um, personally, I think that's a real shame because if we go back to the point that we made that power of this is about the subject matter experts. So, um, uh, consultants, they can't do this work for you. A consultancy can show you how to map as can Matt camp as can a whole raft of other online content.</p>
<p>But the real power is the conversation. Um, and there is about, um, getting the, the real experts to have that conversation. So for, for me personally, um, if, you know, if anybody is poked into their session and, um, works in government or healthcare and wants a, you know, an hour or two of kicking the tires on our mapping, um, they started Christmas.</p>
<p>Um, I will happily, um, try to convince Julie off-camera to join me, um, and see if we couldn't do an hour or two and put a bit of a session on for anybody cross government or health care, um, to show them the basics, because I think this is an invaluable tool. Um, and if there was wider adoption, we would have a much better understanding, not just of the department that we work in, but if the end to end, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely very happy to do that, Rachel. And I'm, I'm really proud of some of our more recent maps because, um, with only a small amount of time, they should resonate with people, the stuff we're dealing with in this wider food domain, everybody should get the basics. I recognize that that's food. I recognize that that's a label that that's not hard.</p>
<p>Oh, there's me up there. I'm a consumer that I'm on. I'm on the map. Um, so I think those conversations are easy to have with everybody because you're an expert. Um, whereas where we started with some of the tech, you would be talking to people about it and they sell group service, you know, completely lost me.</p>
<p>Um, don't God knows what that is, but, but we're now as we now move into this sort of bigger real world, I actually think that the, the mapping language should become strangely. Yep. Absolutely agree. And I think the raft of digital tools that the community have built out. So with the rates, you know, the, the Miro board for mapping, um, I know you've shared another online tool that I haven't seen myself today.</p>
<p>So, you know, the, the, the digital aspect is absolutely caught up. Um, but it's the conversation. Um, and, uh, you know, if, if people want a bit of time to learn, learn the basics, um, then yeah, we'd be delighted to help out a very generous offer from Ebola. Thank you so much, even though I feel like Julie was more voluntold than it's ready for a speaking and engagements or mapping and that's well known.</p>
<p>Okay, cool. I wanted pick up on something there. Uh, Yes, there, there was a lot there, but, uh, so we're talking about why isn't there wider spread adoption in government and Julie, during your talk, you specifically emphasized co-created and shared, uh, how did you share like literally how, because I've, I've seen people put up like a huge map with tons of notes on it and then talk through it.</p>
<p>I've seen people build a map in a kind of piece by piece or chunk by chunk. How did you share the map in an effective way? Well, a couple of things, one is, um,</p>
<p>The sharing was actually by the people in the room. We tried to get as many people as we possibly could in, in, into the room. Um, and whilst we had a number of sessions and people were creating their own or building on another one at the being being created and the whole thing was really messy. And, but that didn't matter at all.</p>
<p>Um, so the main sort of sharing was by being there and owning it. The other thing is, um, also for me as whether or not how having said that map is really, really important. Um, and I've said this to Simon before I do this. Cause I think of the world in maps anyway. So that's, what's going on in my, my head anyway, um, E equally, well, um, and like tried to draw this out in my presentation.</p>
<p>Was it the map? That's not, that's not the end. The map. It's the, so what, so what did we do about it? And so the, the, what did we do about it? We're focusing on some of our arrows, which will translate down into, we created a training course, or we implemented this, or we built a thing. Um, and then you're then heading off, down into, you know, normal traditional sort of design and delivery territory.</p>
<p>Um, so I, I don't want to all, you may be taking them back down to another level of detail as you design a particular part of the digital service that you've decided is, is needed. Um, but I D I think we need to understand what the maps are there for, and then everything else that has to happen has to be action of some sort.</p>
<p>Okay. So I'm going to repeat that. What I think I heard, and you can tell me how wrong I am. Um, but the co-created and the shared necessarily go together. So even if it's kind of going viral and like, okay, well, someone took this chunk of the map and then continued the creation with another group. But the co-created in the shared go together.</p>
<p>Yes. Right. Then the actual artifact of the math is not really the thing. It's what that inspires us to do. Or the questions that prompts the investigation, that all of those things, so that, uh, sharing the artifact is kind of like, yeah. It's how to make those movements have to move what you've got on the map.</p>
<p>You can identify where you want to move it. And so what is it that sets to make that happen? Okay. Cool. Rachel, are you, are you thinking, going to comment? I was just nodding furiously. Um, I think it, I think the artifact is important. Um, but I think the conversation is, is so important and the bit that I never ever, um, the bit that always amuses me or amazes me is when you've got people that work in the same team or same department or same organization, you ask them to describe something that goes on and you've got 10 people in the room and every one of them calls a, uh, you know, a system or a widget, something different.</p>
<p>Um, and then as they're explaining it, you know, that kind of power of the room getting behind, oh, this is actually what it means. That's what you're getting at, um, is, is, is just invaluable. Yeah, totally agree. That's been my experience as well. Why not? Their thing? I can ask whatever I want. Um, oh actually we have a question in the chat and it's one that I'm super interested in.</p>
<p>So Jonathan is back with another question. Thank you, Jonathan. Uh, we have a large focus on accessibility at the moment. I'm struggling to see how people with visual impairments can take part in mapping and get value from it. Do you have experience with this? Do either of you have experience? I do. So I can certainly give my I don't, so I wouldn't profess to try and answer those phones.</p>
<p>Okay. Um, I'll say what I've done before and then Rachel and Julie, you can tell them. How wrong it is and how badly it needs to be improved. But I actually, someone who is more and more active in the mapping community, Jimmy Jud, you can look him up he's on Twitter and things like that, but he is blind and he's a mapper.</p>
<p>And, uh, what we did mapping together was really take advantage of. The language, right. That we have a shared set of language. So that language is actually really rich for describing the landscape. Right. And yes, we have this visual artifact that's there. Right. But we can also just describe a landscape with that language.</p>
<p>And now that we have the amazing online Wardley mapping, which I shared in the, um, chat, and then there's also a BS code plug in now, uh, same thing. So that's using the Wardley mapping language, uh, to generate a map, you know, like it's code sort of, uh, that has also been really helpful because that you can read that with a screen reader and that's something.</p>
<p>That I've found to be really, really helpful. And I will also take this opportunity to plug a Ben Mosher's YouTube channel. I think it's, I think it's Lauren Wardley mapping. I'm not sure. Uh, I'll find a link and I'll post it, but Jimmy and Ben did some mapping together on that YouTube channel. So if you're curious about that, uh, go for it.</p>
<p>And maybe next year we'll have Jimmy as a math camp speaker. If I can convince him, or if all of you want to help me peer pressure him, he's an excellent speaker. Um, but that's the approach that we used for Wardley mapping together. And I think it's been successful. I think Jimmy feels the same way. So.</p>
<p>Yeah. We'd love to give that a try. We, I admit we haven't, um, we've just completely failed so far. Um, but yeah, we, we would want to make sure that the maps are as accessible as possible. Yeah. I just can't say enough. Good things about the vs code plugin online Wardley maps, PS code plugin. Like it is fantastic.</p>
<p>I love it. And I think it goes a long way and providing accessible maps. So yes. Uh, yes. So we're, we're reaching the end of our time, I think. Uh, so maybe we can do some, some parting thoughts and I'll start with mine so that Rachel and Julia have time to think about yours. Something that really stood out to me.</p>
<p>Yes. We covered the supply chain stuff is common, but that's something that really stood out to me was basically what are the boundaries of a mat like Rachel talked about? Oh, and we got to get all of these pieces to somehow align and people have to have a lot of faith and Goodwill and. And then Julie, you were talking about, you know, there's ton, the supply chain for this food is just so expansive.</p>
<p>And I started to think about something that Mel Conway told me. He said, you can zoom in forever, or you could zoom out forever. Right. And neither of those exercises are helpful. And he sent me the ACOF talk from mechanistic to systems thinking, and Aycock says that, right. That it's not helpful to zoom in forever.</p>
<p>It's not helpful as zoom out forever. You have to be somewhere. Right. So that seemed like a real. Thread, uh, both in terms of like, we could zoom in forever in terms of the supply chain, we could zoom out. Same way we could zoom in forever, like on the actors and zoom out. Uh, but also time that struck me, right.</p>
<p>That we can zoom in on time. This instant we could zoom out forever and neither of those are going to be really helpful. We have to like pick a scope if we're going to move forward. Uh, so that was something that just really stood out to me across both of them. I think maybe because there is the pressure of safety that that's not something that you can sit there forever.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, gee whiz, let me get philosophical and zoom way out. Right? Like here's a pressing concern. You have to do something and it has to be. Uh, at an appropriate scale. So, uh, I don't know if you, yeah, no, I was just, um, as you say, thank you for the time to, to think. Um, yeah, it's, it's a great point. Um, first you mentioned time and I think time is really important anyways.</p>
<p>So whilst we shouldn't be infinitely worrying about time at the same time, I think it is, um, healthy for us to spend a bit more time thinking about time, time you notice, how fast things, things move, um, have tightly coupled things, things are from a time perspective. So, um, I, I would be pushing much more for people to think about that.</p>
<p>Um, then your, your, your point around, um, the sort of like the boundaries and the, you know, zooming out and chiming in and infinite, um, scales, et cetera. Two things that I think one is, yes, it's dangerous. I agree. Um, but one is that the mapping makes you aware of the boundaries. It makes you ask the question as to we going too far.</p>
<p>Do we still need to go out here or we, we done enough's enough, but being able to map it means that you can actually have that conversation around some of the nether regions, um, uh, around, around the map. So I think, I think that's powerful. Um, everyone can then decide, um, and have a, sort of a joint understanding of why we put in the boundary where, where we do and the other was.</p>
<p>And all of my, um, examples did start with this and maybe I should have brought it out more it's that it is that anchor it's that use case it's that particular sort of situation it's the problem I'm trying to solve. Um, so we weren't just sort of heading off generally to go map the food system. Cause it looked, looked fun.</p>
<p>Um, it was because somebody suggested we needed to do something to address a particular problem that we were facing a real, a real problem. So what do we do? What's the response. And again, it comes back to the, the, so what that comes out of the whole process, you go in with that problem, and then you come, come out with process, even if in the meantime you realize that you might've asked the wrong question, um, in, in the first place.</p>
<p>So going in might be an iterative, um, um, exercise as, as you go in. Yeah, go in with that, with that use case, with that problem statement. Oh yeah. I can't imagine that mapping the food system. Wouldn't be an exciting task, Julie. Um, the,</p>
<p>um, the, the, the bit for me and you'd answered the question actually yourself, but the bit for me is about. It's the business context. So I'm not that philosophical. Um, and so that's the part I get boat. Um, and so it's much more around, um, how wide to you go is in line with the business context. So I like the zooming in and zooming out.</p>
<p>Um, but even yesterday when, when and teaching mapping again, um, and you know, there's, there's always somebody, if you're doing the analogy of the cafe that wants to talk about a cow in the field for the milk, and it's like, you know, not the point. Um, and, and so, um, it's, it's just about, you know, enough, um, for, for me, but I'm somebody with a serious, they short attention span.</p>
<p>Um, so therefore that might have something to wear something to do with it. The other reflection for me, I think is, is around two reflections of one around supply chain and understanding that aspect more. Um, and the other bit is around the adoption of mapping because the power of it is, is just so far reaching.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, I really think that we're missing a trick from a government and a chess perspective, not utilizing it more. So, um, yeah, that's, uh, another reflection from. Wonderful. Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. And thank you for spending a little bit of extra time, because we didn't have a third speaker, but I'm actually very happy that we got that extra time for questions.</p>
<p>So I really, really appreciate it. And to the folks who are in attendance, I hope to see you later today on the society track reminder, all of the talks are recorded. So if you feel you must visit another track, don't worry because you can watch the talks later. Um, I will also just say that Mel Conway I mentioned earlier is giving a talk later.</p>
<p>I think it's the next session on this track. If you're interested in that, um, I think that's it. And a reminder there's the networking space and I'll probably pop over to. For a few minutes to say hello to folks after we leave here. But I think that's it. So thank you both so much and thank you to the audience.</p>
<p>Great questions. Yeah. Thanks cat. You did a brilliant job. Thanks very much. Excellent. Thank you. I thank you. Take care.</p>
